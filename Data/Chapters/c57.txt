dago質問
D: I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW QUICKLY CAN CAPTAIN KURO RUN 100
METERS?
O: TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO MEASURE HIS
SPEED CORRECTLY, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN
SECONDS. THINK OF IT AS 4 POINT SOMETHING. WHOA! THAT'S A
WORLD RECORD.
D: ARE PATTY AND CARNE'S NAMES FROM "SPAGHETTI" AND
"CALZONE"? (CALZONE SPELLED IN JAPANESE IS KARUTSUIONE, AND
CARNE IS SPELLED CARUNE)
O:
HMMM! IT IS TRUE THAT THEIR NAMES ARE DERIVED FROM
FOOD-RELATED WORDS, BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT. PATTY IS TAKEN
FROM THE NAME OF A TYPE OF DESSERT CHEF (PATISSIERE). AND
CARNE IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE SPANISH WORD FOR MEAT.
D: IF LUFFY GETS 7,200 FUNKY GOMU GOMUS, DOES THAT MEAN SANJI
IS ABOUT 8,500 FUNKY ERO EROS?
O: OH, NO, NOT AT ALL. HE CAN GET AT LEAST 930 MERCHEN ERO
EROS.
D: COULD YOU MAKE THE ONE PIECE TANKOBON A LITTLE CHEAPER?
(LIKE 100 YEN...)
O: RIGHT NOW... 1 BOOK IS 410 YEN. AND JUMP COSTS 220 YEN.
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, A TANKOBON WAS 360 YEN
AND A JUMP COST 170 YEN. BUT THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING RISES.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. IT'S THE SAME FOR
EVERYONE. AND 100 YEN IS JUST NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
D:
SENSE! WHEN YOU ARE DRAWING THE CHARACTERS OF ONE PIECE,
AND LUFFY IS MAD, FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU GET A MAD EXPRESSION
ON YOUR FACE, OR LOOK REALLY STRAINED?? TELL ME!! I DO IT.
O: OH, I SURE DO. I MAKE LOTS OF FACES WHEN I DRAW. WHEN I
DREW THE DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD OF THE BREAK-UP OF THE USOPP
PIRATE CREW, MY FACE GOT REALLY TIRED. I CRIED SO MUCH WHEN
I DREW THAT, I THOUGHT MY FACE WAS GOING TO CRAMP UP.
