CHAPTER NOTES:
The "Kazenbo" is a demon from
Toriyama Sekien's picture book
"Konjaku Hyakki Shui"
(A Guide to a Hundred Demons,
Past and Present).
It was believed to appear in Mt. Toribe
in Kyoto, which was known as an old
burial ground in the Heian period.
It is portrayed as a beggar bonze
(Buddhist teacher) who is engulfed
by flames and smoke.
