THE INJURED
SUN PIRATES, AND
THEN THE FAREWELL
PARTY GOT ALL
ROWDY...
I'M
SORRY! I WAS
TENDING TC
I WAS
REALLY
WORRIED,
MAN!
HOW
HEARTEN-
ING!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
JINBE, THE FORMER
SHICHIBUKAI, IS
NOW ONE OF OUR
CREWMEMBERS!900
THE LARGE
SKULL ON THE ISLAND
HAS BECOME PART OF
THESE MOUNTAINS, AND
INSIDE THAT SKULL IS
WHERE KAIDO'S
CASTLE IS.
THE BLUEPRINTS
THAT WE GOT OUR
HANDS ON TELL US
THAT IT HAS A REAR
ENTRANCE. THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE AIMING FOR.
AND
THEN WE'LL
AMBUSH KAIDO
WHILE HE'S
SLOSHED!
AGAIN? JUST
HOW SMART DOES
THIS GuY THINK
YOU ARE?!
THE ISLAND
OF ONIGASHIMA
IS SURROUNDED BY
MOUNTAINS! THERE IS
ONLY ONE WAY INTO
ITS INTERIOR: WHAT
IS KNOWN AS THE
"FRONT GATE."
ONIGASHIMA
WE'LL
SPLIT OUR FORCE
INTO TWO AND GO LEFT
AND RIGHT, THROUGH THE
MOLINTAIN PATHS, TO GET
TO THE REAR ENTRANCE.
FROM THERE, WE'LL
INFILTRATE THE
CASTLE.
WHAT IS
OUR TRUE
STRATEGY?
I SEE.
THIS MUST BE
THE PLAN YOU TOLE
KANJURO AS WELL,
TO DECEIVE HIM.AND THE THREE
PIRATE CAPTAINS:
ME, STRAW HAT-YA,
AND ELISTASS-YA.
THEIR PRIORITY
TARGET WILL BE THE
RED SCABBARD
SAMURAI
FIRST THINGS
FIRST! ASSUMING
THE ENEMY KNOWS
OF OUR RAID..
THESE
FOR THIS REASON,
WE'LL PROCEED AS
IDIOTS
PLANNED, AND SPLIT UP
WILL BE
OUR TROOPS BETWEEN EXCELLENT
THE LEFT- AND RIGHT-
MOUNTAIN PATHS.
DECOYS!
CHARGE AT
THE ENEMY
HEAD ON!
THERE ARE
GOING TO BE
APPROXIMATELY
TWO SETS OF
IDIOTS THAT WILL
REFUSE TO DO
ANYTHING BUT
AND NO MATTER
HOW CAREFULLY
YOU LOT DESIGN
YOUR PLANS
BUT
THOSE TROOPS
WILL ALSO BE
DECOYS!
RIGHT
IDIOTS?!
WHERE
WILL THE RED
SCABBARDS
GO, THEN?!
THAT OUR ROLE
IN THIS FIGHT IS
PRIMARILY TO SEE
DON'T
THAT KINEMON AND
GET ME WRONG,
THE OTHERS REACH WE'VE ALREADY
THE SITE OF THEIR
ACCEPTED
FINAL BATTLE,
BUT..
HuH?!AND
EVEN AVOID THE
WHIRLPOOLS THAT
PREVENT LANDINGS
ON THE COAST.
MY SUBMARINE
WILL ALLOW US TO
GO AROUND TO THE
BACK OF THE
ISLAND
BY SEA
OF COURSE!
I
• CAN
THEN USE MY
POWERS TO EASILY
GET YOU INSIDE
THE ISLAND.
UNDERSTOOD.
WE'LL SAVE OUR
STRENGTH
I WILL
INDEED! WE
THEREFORE
WILL NEED ONE
ALSO GO BY THE
COMMANDER FOR
MOUNTAIN PATHS! EACH GROUP, BOTH
PLEASE TAKE
THE LEFT AND
THE OTHERS,
THE RIGHT!
SIR LAW!
BUT I FEAR
I MUST STAY
BACK, TO LEAD
OUR MEN!
HMM.
I APPRECIATE
