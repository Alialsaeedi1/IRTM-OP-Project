TALES OF-THE SELF-PROCLAIMED STRAW HAT GRAND FLEET VOL. 42: SIDE STORY
"THIS IS A DYED-GOODS TOWN.
ELICHIRO ODAChapter 909:
MOTOTE

The mask this woman wears unless that's what she actually
looks likel is a reference to Inari gods. Inari gods are the Shinto
god of foxes, fertility, agriculture, and industry. There is usually
a festival once a year and fox masks are often sold and worn
to celebrate the occasion. In fact, you may have noticed other
anime/ manga with characters of the same inspiration as it's
got a captive design.
Street-murderer:
The Japanese word for this is Tsujigiri (it#h)) , which is
actually a very specific term (literally
"crossroad slashing"). It
refers to random killings made by samurais on the streets at
night, often in order to test out a new sword or technique.Chapter 913 cont:
Jyagan grass
de&# (yagansou) is an herb found in Asia. When mixed with
other herbs, it can have many different effects, such as
reducing fever or easing indigestion. Oda switches the
HE (snake) and 9ß (evil/miasma) kanjt, which is fitting,
considering it is to treat poison.Chapter 913:
Warabide:
As mentioned in the T/N, the Warabide-tou is one of the oldest
types of Japanese daggers. Warabide means fern-shoot, which
refers to the hilt/handle which looks like a fern-shoot. Oda
changes the Japanese character
"wara'
"from
"fern" to
"straw" to match Hawkins ability.
O-tsuru
You may have noticed that Oda has overlapped names with the
introduction of O-tsurv, as there is also the marine surv. The
difference here is that the marine Tsurv is spelt in Hiragana
(73) in the Japanese. In fact, almost all One Piece
character names are written in either Hiragana or Katakana.
The Tsuru we see in Wano Country, however, is spelt out with
the Kanii (Chinese character) for Crane (#). As such, Japanese
readers will have no trouble differentiating between the two,
while it might confuse English readers. Similarly, O-tama is also
written with the Kanji for "ball" (referring to her ability to
make dangol. As such, we can expect most, if not all, Wano
country residents to have proper Japanese names.Chapter 914 cont:
ldaten:（韋駄天）
This is the Japanese name for the swift-footed guardian diety,
Skanda. It is commonly used to describe someone who runs fast.
Bakura district (博羅町）
This one is a bit tricky, as the name has no obvious references as
far as I know. The only reference I could find is a Chinese county
under the same name that flourishes from rich agriculture.Chapter 914:
Suffixes:
You may have noticed a lack of suffixes in this chapter and
wondered why. Originally, we added suffixes on due to its
significance, such as Jibe referring to Luffy as Luffy-san instead of
Luffy-kun once Luffy became his captain. Following from that, we
continued using suffixes in order to maintain consistency, and it
wasn't a big issue as most people in One Piece don't usually use
suffixes anyway. However, as Wano has a traditional Japanese
setting, the inhabitants speak much more formally lo-tama-chan,
o-tsurv-san), and it is quite clear now that it's unsustainable. It
would be much too tedious to have to read these suffixes multiple
times in every single sentence. Therefore, we are removing suffixes. If
any of importance come up, we will leave a short T/N to highlight it.

Hello! JB One Piece Translator here!
Just making a quick announcement that we will be adding a
references page at the end of each chapter for the duration of
the Wano arc.
Normally, we would leave explanations in translator's notes,
but I'm sure you would have noticed the dramatic increase since
the Wano are started. It has since become quite impractical, as
some of the Japanese phrases require long explanations. To be
honest, we should have anticipated it, being a long japan-based
arc and all. But better late than never (haha..!!
There are also a few things I've picked that may not be
immediately obvious to English readers, so we will be
incorporating these, too! My knowledge is limited though, so
forgive me if I miss out on anything. We will still leave
translator's notes for any short explanations like
attack/character names etc. though, so that you can still have
a complete experience without reading the reference pages. As
such, let's begin on the next page! (I'Il be including some stuff
from previous chapters as well!)WAIT,
I'M GOING,
TOO!!
TAKE NE,
TOO!!
DOOO
