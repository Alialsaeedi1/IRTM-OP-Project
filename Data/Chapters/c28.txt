QUESTIONS
ANSWERS
D: THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK YOU,
SENSEI. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE THINGS THAT THE
READERS SEND YOU?
O: I PLACE THEM ALL IN MY ROOM. AND I PERSONALLY READ
ALL THE LETTERS AND POSTCARDS THAT THE READERS
SEND ME. THESE LETTERS GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO
WORK EVEN HARDER. IN OTHER WORDS, THANKS TO YOUR
MAIL. I CAN CONTINUE DRAWING AS A MANGAKA. THANKS
EVERYBODY!
D: DOES THE ORIGIN OF ZORO'S LAST NAME COME FROM
THE PIRATE KNOWN AS "FRANCOIS L'OLLONAIS"?
O: THAT IS CORRECT! THE NAME REALLY WAS TAKEN FROM
THE SO CALLED "MOST FIERCE & CRUEL PIRATE FRANCOIS
L'OLLONAIS OF THE CARRIBEAN SEA." THAT NAME
"MORGAN", AND "ALVIDA" ARE ALL REAL NAMES OF REAL
PIRATES.
R: READ THE INFO FILE FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING
THESE PIRATES.
D: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT CAPTAIN BUGGY! ARE THE TWO
PONYTAILS THAT POP OUT FROM HIS HAT ACTUALLY HIS
HAIR? OR ARE THEY JUST SOME KIND OF DECORATION,
OR A WIG? I REALLY WANT TO KNOW! BUT, IF THAT'S
REALLY HIS HAIR, THEN HE SURE HAS LONG HAIR...
O: A LOT OF READERS HAVE MAILED ME ASKING THE SAME
QUESTION. LET ME SHOW EVERYBODY THE DETAILS!
