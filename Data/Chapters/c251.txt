D: G'MORNING. UM.. VOL25 CHAPTER 235
PAGE 174 I READ "THAT'S!! "MARRON"!!!!"
I'M PRETTY SURE OTHERS HAVE READ IT
THAT WAY. (BECAUSE IT'S A CHESTNUT. AND
IT'S CRICKET. HIS HEAD) ... HOW 'BOUT YOU
JUST MAKE IT "MARRON"?

. NO. WHAT'RE YOU SAYING? COME ON... JAYA ARC'S THEME?
YOU KNOW? IT'S "A MAN'S ROMANCE"*!!! AH! HE'S SO COOL.
WHAT MARRON... THAT'S TOTALLY WRONG. I'LL SAY THIS,
BUT THAT PART SAYS NOTHING ABOUT A MARRON OR ANY
CHESTNUT. ILL SAY IT CLEARLY THIS TIME. THE THEME FOR
THE JAYA ARC IS "A MAN'S MARRO... ROMANCE!!!"
D: ODA SENSE, HELLO! I WAS LOOKING
THROUGH THIS BOOK ABOUT MONSTERS,
AND I CAME UPON THIS CHINESE MONKEY
MONSTER CALLED A "SHOUJOU." IS THAT
WHERE SHOUJOU'S NAME COMES FROM?
BY FUJIKO-
0: NN. I GUESS IF YOU TRACE IT. IT'S WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY IN
JAPANESE, AND IT DOES POINT TO THE MONSTER THING, BUT IT'S
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE ORANGUTAN. YES, IT'S TAKEN
EXACTLY. OH AND MASHIRA'S ALSO LIKE THAT. JAPANESE PEOPLE
USED TO CALL MONKEYS "MASHIRA"
WHAT A MAN THINKS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER.
