LIFE HOWEVER
YOU WANT!!!
THIS MAY BE KIND
OF RUDE TO YOU

mangareade)SURE ENOLGH,
HE COULD BE
FEROCIOUS, SHORT-
TEMPERED AND
SELFISH IF YOU
MADE HIM MAD
...BUT EVERY ACTION
THAT HE TOOK WAS
AS SIMPLE AND
HONEST AS THAT
OF A CHILD.
THE WORLD MAY HAVE
SEEN HIM AS THE
ULTIMATE EVIL, BLIT
THE TRUST HE EARNED
FROM HIS CREW WAS
IMMEASURABLE.
N- NO,
NOT AT
ALL.
I GUESS YOU
REALLY CAN'T...
GO AGAINST
YOUR BLOOD.
JUST BECALISE
THEY SPOKE ILL
OF HIS CREW.
HE WAS EVEN
KNOWN TO WIPE
OUT AN ENTIRE
COUNTRY'S
MILITARY...
IT'S THE FACT THAT
HE LIVED HIS LIFE
IN THAT WAY AND
STILL HAD THE LUCK
TO SURVIVE THAT
MADE HIM THE
PIRATE KING.
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF
PROBLEM..
...WE'RE
THE ONES
WHO'VE TAKEN
)
IN ACE!!
AT TIMES LIKE
THAT, ROGER
BECAME A TRUE
DEMON!!
PERHAPS BECAUSE
HE GREW UP IN
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT
UNLIKE THOSE ACE
IS GOING THROUGH
RIGHT NOW...
HE DETESTED
THE THOUGHT OF
LOSING HIS LOVED
ONES ABOVE
ALL ELSE...
EVEN I, AS A MARINE
SOLDIER, COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO HATE
THE MAN... THAT'S WHY
I DECIDED TO TAKE
IN ACE.

RACE... YOU HAVE
TO BE LUCKY TO
EVEN WITNESS
ONE WITHIN YOUR
LIFETIME...
THERE ARE
