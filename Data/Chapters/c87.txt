SITUATION
OVER

RISK THEIR LIVES

LIKE THEY DO!
NOR DO
I HAVE
THE RIGHT
TO LAUGH
WITH THEM!
CERTAIN
KILL

ATTACK FROM
SOME HALF FISH
BASTARD COULD
EVER HIT ME!
FROM THE
MOMENT I
TOOK ONE
STEP OUTSIDE
MY VILLAGE,
I SHOULD'VE
THROWN AWAY
ALL NOTIONS OF
"PEACE" OR
"SAFETY"
THAT'S WHY
I DECIDED TO
GO OUT TO
THE SEAS
AS WELL!
THEY CAN
LAUGH FROM
THE BOTTOM
OF THEIR
HEARTS
LIKE THAT!
IF I DON'T
FIGHT SERIOUSLY
RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO SAIL
ON THE SAME SHIP
AS THEM!
aneBUT I'LL BLAST
YOU OUT OF
YOUR HIDING
SPOT WITH
THIS FIELD'S
WATER! CHU!
ILL DIE
IF T
LOSE!
I'M
ALREADY
A REAL
PIRATE!

HUMAN AND HIS
IDIOTIC STUNTS...
I DON'T
KNOW
WHERE
YOU'RE
HIDING,
CHU
C
THIS
FIGHT ISN'T
SOMETHING
THAT THE
MAN USOPP
CAN JUST
RUN AWAY
FROM!

MATTER

STUPID OR
COWARDLY!

D:
SENSE! I THOUGHT OF A NEW MOVE FOR LUFFY-CHAN. IT GOES
LIKE THIS... LUFFY STRETCHES HIS MOUTH OUT AND EATS THE
ENEMY, THEN HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM AND POOPS IT OUT!
HOW'S THAT? IT'S GOOD, RIGHT? A GOOD IDEA.
O: NO, IT'S NOT.
D: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ODA-SENSEI. WHAT DO YOU CALL
BELLEMERE-SAN'S HAIRCUT?
O:
THAT HAIRSTYLE IS CALLED "WOMEN HAVE GUTS." YOU SHOULD YELL IT
OUT IN A BEAUTY PARLOR.
O: I'M GLAD SANJI IS "GIRL-CRAZY," NOT "BOY-CRAZY."
D: UH, TOTALLY.
D: WHEN SANJI THINKS ABOUT A GIRL, THE SMOKE FROM HIS
CIGARETTE TURNS INTO A HEART SHAPE. HOW DOES HE DO IT? I
WANT TO TRY TOO!! PLEASE (X100) TELL ME!
O: UH, FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO BE OVER 20. THEN LIGHT YOUR
CIGARETTE AND TAKE A BIG DRAG. WHEN YOU DO THAT, THE SMOKE
WILL COME IN CONTACT WITH THE "FEELING OF LOVE" YOU PLIT IN
YOUR LUNGS BEFOREHAND, AND THEN WHEN YOU BLOW THE SMOKE
OUT, IT WILL MOST SURELY COME OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A HEART.
D: I CAN'T REALLY TELL IF YOSAKU AND JOHNNY ARE STRONG OR NOT.
IT'S DEFINITELY BY A HAIR. TO BE TOTALLY STRAIGHT, BETWEEN
THOSE TWO AND HELMEPP, WHO CAN STRETCH FURTHER?
O: I HOPE THAT KAYA WILL BECOME A WONDERFUL DOCTOR.
