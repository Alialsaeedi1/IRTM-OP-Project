YEAH.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO
HELP OURSELVES.
BECAUSE
THE ARLONG
PIRATES WOLLD
EASILY DESTROY
THEM!
BUT THEY
WERE ALL
SO EASILY
SUNK.
AFTER
ARLONG
TOOK ME TO
THEIR SHIP,
I'M CERTAIN..
THAT THE
GOVERNMENT
WON'T EVER
SEND HELP TO
THIS ISLAND.
5 MARINE
SHIPS CAME
AFTER THEM.
164NOOOO!
LET GO
OF ME!
SURE
THING!
SHE'S A VALLABLE
TALENT. BRING HER
ALONG. HACHI!
LET GO OF

KUROOBI
GEN!

GO OF
THAT
GIRL
RIGHT
NOW!
r.neTHE TIME FOR
US TO DECIDE
IS NOW.
IT SEEMS
THEY'RE
PLANNING ON
SETTING UP
BASE ON THIS
ISLAND!
WE'VE FIGURED
OUT WHERE
THE ARLONG
PIRATES ARE.
OR ACCEPT THEIR
RULE, UNDER
WHICH WE'LL LIVE
UNDER CONSTANT
FEAR OF DEATH,
AND HOPE THAT
THE GOVERNMENT
WILL ONE DAY COME
TO SAVE US!?
SHALL WE
GO OUT
FIGHTING,
BRAVING
DEATH,
BUT THE MARINE
HEADQUARTERS
ALREADY HAVE
THEIR HANDS
FULL WITH THE
GRAND LINE,
(785553555722229
NO..
THE ONLY
ONES IN THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT CAN HOPE
TO MATCH THESE
MONSTERS,
SPIN
SPIN
SO HOPING FOR
THEM TO COME
ALL THE WAY OUT
TO THESE REMOTE
REGIONS IS
USELESS!
ARE THOSE FROM
THE MARINE
HEADQUARTERS
IN GRAND LINE...
158THEY ARE OUR
FIRST SOURCE
OF INCOME,
AFTER ALL
GO LIGHTLY
ON THEM.

SPIN
SPIN

156WE WERE NAIVE,
THE MARINES
WON'T COME TO
SAVE US EITHER.
OF SENDING NAMI
AND NOJIKO AWAY ON
A BOAT IS NOW...
EVEN
OUR
IDEA,
ALL THE SHIPS
IN THE VILLAGE
HAVE BEEN
SUNK.
THIS ISLAND
IS NOW
COMPLETELY
UNDER THEIR
CONTROL.
AND THAT THE
ONLY WAY TO
SURVIVE WAS
TO LIVE UNDER
THEIR RULE..
THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR US
TO ESCAPE
FROM THIS
SITUATION
BELLEMERE
MUST'VE
ALREADY
REALIZED
BACK THEN,
BELLEMERE..
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED
TO DO.
NAMI'S BEEN
TAKEN AWAY
TOO..
157WELL I HAVE
NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO
IT MYSELF!
BECALISE
I KNOW
EVERYONE IS
DOING THEIR
BEST JUST
TO PAY THE
TRIBUTE.
BUT...
WON'T
IT BE HARD?
I CAN
IT'S YOU'LL HAVE
STILL SMILE
EVEN WHEN FINE!
TO WORK
LOOKING AT
WITH THE ONE
WHO KILLED
HIS FACE.
BELLEMERE,
AND THAT
I'LL FIGHT
ALONE!
YOU'RE GOING TO
BUY THE VILLAGE
FROM THEM WITH
1100 MILLION BELI!?
BUT EVEN
AN ADULT
WORKING
HIS ENTIRE
LIFE AWAY
PROBABLY
COULDN'T
RAISE UP
THAT MUCH
MONEY!
YUP.
IN RETURN,
I HAVE TO
JOIN THEIR
CREW AND
DRAW MAPS
FOR THEM.
I..
. I DON'T
EVER WANT
THAT TO
HAPPEN
AGAIN..
AND IF I
ASK ANYONE
FOR HELP
AGAIN...
THEY'LL
JUST END UP
INJURED..
I'VE
DECIDED TO
NEVER CRY
AGAIN!
