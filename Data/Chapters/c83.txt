D:
WHEN THE ALONG GUYS AND THE OTHER FISHMEN GIVE BIRTH,
DO THEY LAY EGGS LIKE FISH?
O:
BZZZT. FISHMEN ARE STILL MAMMALS, SO THEY GIVE BIRTH THE WAY
HUMANS DO. THERE ARE FISHWOMEN TOO, OF COURSE.
D: I WANNA KNOW THE HEIGHT OF ALL FIVE. NAMI'S REALLY CUTE.
O:
THE MAIN FIVE, YOU MEAN? I'LL GET THIS ONE OUT OF THE WAY.
FIRST OF ALL, GAIMON'S HEIGHT IS... KIDDING. ILL START FROM THE
SHORTEST. NAMI'S HEIGHT IS 169CM, LUFFY IS 172CM, USOPP IS
174CM, SANJI IS 177CM, AND ZORO IS 178CM. SO THEY'RE ALL PRETTY
MUCH THE SAME HEIGHT.
D:
OF ALL THE FISHMEN, HATCHAN IS THE CUTEST AND FUNNIEST. BUT
THERE'S ONE THING THAT BUGS ME. WHY IS HATCHAN'S FULL
NAME HATCHAN, AND HIS NICKNAME HACHI?
O: A LOT OF CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE NAMES THAT GO **** CHAN (CHANG
OR ZHANG IN THE ENGLISH ALPHABET). SO IT SHOULD BE JUST FINE.
D: WHAT IS THE THING THAT USOPP AND A LOT OF THE PIRATES IN
ONE PIECE HAVE TIED AROUND THEIR WAISTS? A TOWEL? OR DID
THEY WANT ONE OF ZORO'S STOMACH BANDS, BUT THEY COULDN'T
GET ONE FOR THEMSELVES, SO THEY USED THOSE INSTEAD?
O.
4 THESE THINGS? THEY DO ALL HAVE THEM, DON'T
THEY? THERE'S NO REAL DEEP REASON FOR THEM,
THOUGH. I GUESS PIRATES JUST LIKED TO WEAR
THESE "DECORATIVE SASHES." BUT SOMETIMES THEY
PUT THEIR PISTOLS IN THEM, SO MAYBE THEY AREN'T
TOTALLY POINTLESS.
