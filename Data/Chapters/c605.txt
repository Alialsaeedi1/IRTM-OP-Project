D: Nice to meet you Odacchi!! Already, I wil
I ask you, but the covers of Volume 1 and
Volume 61..RIP-OFF!! Dismissed!
EDITA
P.. Chi-chan's friend
O: AHHHHI! SHOOT, I DID IT!! I didn't even
notice~! I had that feeling I drew this
somewhere, ya know-? Yikes, I did it
again, this thing. It's a mistake!! (*To the small children. That was actually
on purpose. Even though it was on purpose, the part of me that pretends
it was a mistake and acts dumb makes me humorous yet even more so.)
D: This is a question, Oda-sensei. During class one time, I had an
emergency but my teacher wouldn't let me go to the bathroom
and I had a super-embarrassing moment. If I had the Hana Hana
no Mi powers, would I be able to bloom a penis in the bathroom
and pee from the classroom? P.N. Loved-kun
.: ….yet again, we have a moronic comment... Yep. Well still,
scientifically, this is possible, That is, "DICK FLEUR"!
D: When Killer takes his meals, does he take off
his mask and eat? Or does he eat with his
mask on? If with his mask still on, will it look
kinda like this (->)? I'm guessing the easiest
food to eat would be stick-type.
from N.way-san.
O: Hmmm - Of course, I assume he eats with his mask on. I think stick-
type is a nice idea. I hear ramen works pretty good too. Looks like his
meals have pasta as a main course every day. Word is that he enjoys
fresh peperoncino, Naporitan, and all those tomato sauce types that
get you dirty with red stuff all over the mask, so it becomes a very
disgusting process. For your information, alcohol is drunk with a
straw.
