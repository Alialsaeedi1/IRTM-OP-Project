YOu LOOK
AFTER THE

SHUSHu!
THAT'S WHAT
EVERYONE
SAYS...
. BUT
I SEE IT IN A
DIFFERENT
WAY
WHILE
I'MIN
HOSPI-
TAL,
JUST
WAITING
FOR HIS
OWNER TO
RETURN?
NO..
THAT
GLY.
THREE
MONTHS
AGO HE
WAS HOSPI-
TALIZED AND
THEN..
THEN...
COULD IT
BE THAT
THE
DOG'S
CONTINU-
ING,
mangareader.netmangareader.net• THE VIKINGS WERE VERY SCARY PEOPLE. TO GET
THEY MET UPON THE SEA AND KILL EVERYONE,
INCLUDING
MERCENARIES,
WITHOUT
MERCY.
AFTER TAKING LOOT OR FOOD, THEY WOULD
SET
FIRE
TO
THE
SHIP
THEY
HAD
JUST
ATTACKED, AND MOVE ON. YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IT, DO YOU?!
BUT THEN!! TO THEM DOING THIS WAS JUST
MAKING AN HONEST BUCK. TAKING WHAT
THEY EARNED AND RETURNING TO THEIR
VILLAGES WITH THEIR WEALTH
WAS THE MEN'S
"JOB"
TO THEM THEIR ACTUAL
-VIKING
JOB WAS BEING A
"FIGHTER". AND
FIGHTING THROUGH
THEIR CAREER WAS
THEIR DIGNITY,
AND IT IS SAID THAT
THEY HID AT THE
"VIK" (THE SEA'S
REAR) BEFORE
ATTACKING
PEOPLE ("ING")
WHICH IS A
POPULAR
THEORY ON
WHY THEY
ARE CALLED
"VIKINGS".
