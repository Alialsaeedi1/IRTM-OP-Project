BADLY WOUNDED ON
SHABONDY, AND HAS
BEEN FORCED TO
RETIRE TO FISHMAN
ISLAND ALREADY.
WHAT?! BUT THEN..
HOW COME THE SHIP
HAS BEEN SAFE FROM
THEN UP UNTIL NOW?
HE WAS WOUNDED
FOR THE SAME
REASON AS
DUVAL...!!!
BECAUSE IT
HAD ONE MORE
DEFENDER.
netAND IF WE EVER
DO RUN INTO
HIM AGAIN.
...IS THE
SAVIOUR OF
OUR CREW.

Keep this in your heart
Request: "Sanji And Some Cute Squirrels Make A Pie" (pen-name NSC Hayao)
mangareader.netD: RIGHT OFF THE BAT, DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN YOU? To go even farther, how young
can you go up to? I'm looking forward to an answer like bro! P.N.-Kun
Y: I enjoy both younger or older. The range around Mana Ashida chan for younger to
about Fune san from Sazae san's voice actor, Miyoko Asou chan for older is OK for me.
BUT, now the one right smack in the middle for me is Mirai Shida chan!!
D: Please tell me Yao-sar's favorite type of alcohol and bar snack. P.N. Igaguri
Y: PAST BOURBON & PARLIAMENT NOW Barley Shochu & Dried
Mullet Roe
D: This is a question, but how exactly do you say Franky's phrase
TSUPER-Id?I often try to copy it with my friend but we can't seem
to do it right. (Hehe) It sorta just turns into a normal "Su-pa-". Please
give me a tip BY Holmes fIll
Y: Breathe deeply, suck in the all the world's evil spirit, filter it
in your body, turn that into power, and loudly ejecting the
word "SUPERRRRRR!" would be good.
D: Franky seems to prefer perverted fashion, but does that go for Yao-san too? If it does, Take this-!!
"Lots of speedos present-!" Feel free; don't hesitate! P.N. Tonbanshingi Chopper
Y: I LOVE IT. I'll be waiting for the Lots of speedos present-. (Miniskirts would be good too!)
D: Question to Yao-san!! HAVE YOV EVER FELT EMBARRASSED DOING FRANKY'S VOICE ACTOR? P.N.P
Y: Hey hey he-y now! No such person would be- tsk tsky tsky +sk-- ... If yo feel embarrassed
you can't do yo work man--
D: What kind of character's seiyu are you targeting next?&from S akira kazumi
Y: Next would be either a cool and quiet handsome type, or a midget chief.
D: IF IT'S OKAY, PLEASE TELL ME YOUR FRANKY-LIKE MISTAKES OF WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.
P.N. Carp
Y: Even if it isn't okay. I'd like to tell you, but it's too grotesque to say in public and u, uh....
well, I guess it'd be fine, so let me tell you. About 10 years ago...
O: HEY, HOLD IT, STOP-!! (Shock) Hold it Mr. Yao! What the hell were you trying to say!!
"A story that's too grotesque! This is a book for young boys you know?!
Y: Yeah, It's fine.
O: Heck it is!! I won't be able to publish it!!
Y: Well, anyway, ya know? I0 years ago in Shin juku when |-- BEEEEEEEEPP!!!
O: Yes, see you in the next volume. (wave)

CONTEST, THEN-

APPARENTLY IT
WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO WITHSTAND
HAVING LOTS OF
HOLES OPENED
IN IT AT ONCE.
FOR INSTANCE,
WE DON'T WANT
TO GET BITTEN
BY A SEA KING'S
FANGS.
AND IF THE
SHIP ITSELF WERE
TO CRASH INTO A
ROCK OR A CLIFF
AND GET BADLY
DAMAGED..
IN OTHER WORDS,
WHAT WE NEED TO
WATCH OUT FOR IS
UNDERSEA CREATURES

I ASKED
RAYLEIGH
ABOUT IT
AFTERWARDS
..BUT THE MARINES
HAD BEEN MODIFYING
HIM BIT BY BIT, AS AN
"EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECT",
CHANGING HIS BODY
MORE AND MORE INTO
A CYBORG.
I DON'T KNOW
WHY HE HAD TO
SUBMIT TO THIS.
I DO NOT
HAVE MUCH
TIME LEFT.
AND AFTER WE
HAD VANISHED
FROM THE ISLAND
HE HAD AGREED TO

MERMAIDS HE HAS
BEEN PINING FOR.

IF WE WERE TO FIRE

REAL STRAW HATS HAVE
DEALT SEVERE DAMAGE
TO TWO OF THE
PACIFISTAS.
THE UNITS WERE

THE
SAME ONES THAT
CORNERED THE STRAW

TO ESCAPE FROM THE

MUST BE FATE,

THAT THERE IS NO
SUCH THING AS
COINCIDENCE IN
THIS WORLD.

WAS ALWAYS
MEANT TO BE..
...TOWARDS
BECOMING
A MAN.

WEARS..

HIS OWN IN THE

FOR HIS
"RESTRUCTURING".
DR. VEGAPUNK...
.BUT THEN...!!
HE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE
KNOWN WHAT WE
WOULD DO AFTER
HE'D SENT US OFF
TO ALL THOSE
DIFFERENT PLACES!!
THAT'S WHY FOR THE
PAST TWO YEARS, DESPITE
HAVING NONE OF HIS ORIGINAL
MEMORIES... HE'S BEEN
FOLLOWING THE ORDERS
OF HIS FORMER SELF,
WAITING UNTIL THE DAY
WE CAME BACK.
DID HE WAIT WITH
THE SHIP DESPITE
THAT?! EVEN THOUGH
HIS PERSONALITY
WAS GONE?!
TA
Es-
KLIMA..
I DON'T
REALLY KNOW
MUCH ABOUT
MY DAD.
THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF IS
LUFFY'S DAD, SINCE
HE'S THE LEADER OF
THE REVOLUTIONARY
ARMY.
IF WE THINK
ABOUT HIS
CONNECTION TO
THE REVOLL-
TIONARIES.
THAT'S JUST
COMPLETELY
SCREWED UP..
WHY WOULD HE
GO SO FAR
FOR US.
BUT THAT
BEAR-GLY
WAS A
GOOD GUY
AFTER ALL,
HUH..
I DON'T SEE ANY
WAY FOR US TO
FIND OUT WHAT HE
WAS TRULY THINKING
AT THIS POINT.
IT LOOKS LIKE IN
THE END, WE'VE ONLY
BEEN ABLE TO SPEND
THESE TWO VALLIABLE
YEARS APART..
...BUT HOLD THAT
KNOWLEDGE IN
YOUR HEARTS. WHEN
IT COMES DOWN TO
IT, BARTHOLOMEW

RES:
retVOICE ACTOR SBS - KAZUKI YAO
D: This is a question to the voice actor, Mr. Kazuki Yao. IS THIS WEEK'S
MR. YAO SUPER? by Shining butter
Y: YES!! I'M SUPER SUPER SUPER THIS WEEK TOO.
D: Mr. Yao, after you glug down a bottle of cola, what sound comes out of
your throat? (P.N. Beads Maniac)
Y: RIGHT AT THE SPOT, A SCREAM OF MAH SOUL.
D: After pushing Northwards throughout the Japanese Islands, does Hurricane
Franky change to *a metamorphic low pressure? P.N. Patchon Il
(A metamorphic low pressure is called a hentai-teikiatsu, which is a
pun with low pressure pervert.)
Y: No, it stays at 1000 hectopascals, takes a lap around the earth,
and then EVOLUTES INTO A SUPER-PERVERT.
D: Franky, Bon-chan, and Jango; which character most resembles you (^.^) ?
P.N.Kagakko no tokko
Y: Hmm, everyone sorta resembles me--. I always wear sunglasses
and stuff, and I love Okama-chans, and at home I'm always in just
my underpants so...
P: Hello Mr. Yao! You've always been on the enemy side, but when you found
out you wher doing Franky's voice, what did you think? P.N. Tarao
Y: I thought "Sheesh, finally a nakama!"
D: Right now in ONE PIECE anime, I think you have done many characters
other than Franky such as Jango and Mr. 1, but honestly, which role do you
think was the most exiting and fun? P.N. Tamitami
Y: Honestly, Bon Kurei. But I'm also lookin' foward to NEW Franky-
