WHEN DID覺悶习
D: NICE TO MEET YOU, ODA-SENSEI! I LOVE THE MANGA YOU DRAW,
"NEP ECE"
O:
RRRRRRGH! DAMN!! .
...I LOVE IT WHEN BOYS AND GIRLS
MISREAD AND OMIT THE LETTERS LIKE THAT. MAKES ME WONDER
IF ANYONE CAN READ THOSE WEIRD LETTERS. I'M SORRY FOR
MAKING THE "O" AND "I" IN THE TITLE LOGO PICTURES AND NOT
SIMPLE LETTERS. IT'S CORRECTLY SPELLED "ONE PIECE",
REMEMBER THAT IF YOU HAVE THE TIME.
D: WHAT DOES THE "MöWE" WRITTEN ON MORGAN'S CHIN MEAN?
O: IT'S A GERMAN WORD. IT MEANS "SEAGULL", THE
PRONUNCIATION IS KIND OF LIKE "MEHVE", HE REALLY IS A
SAILOR, ISN'T HE.
D:
YOU KNOW, WITH ZORO'S 3-SWORD STYLE, I DON'T THINK HE'D
BE ABLE TO TALK WITH THE SWORD IN HIS MOUTH... COULD IT
BE... VENTRILOQUISM?
O: IT'S HIS HEART SPEAKING.
D: YOU DON'T SEEM TO USE MUCH TONE. IS THERE A REASON?
O: WELL, IT TAKES FOREVER TO START AFFIXING THE TONE. IT
TAKES A LOT OF TIME (AND IT'S A PAIN IN THE--)... MY POLICY
IS, IF YOU CAN ONLY DO PARTIAL TONE, IT'S BETTER JUST TO
MAKE IT BLACK AND WHITE. THAT'S MY POLICY.
