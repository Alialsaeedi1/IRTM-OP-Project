[ABOUT BS'S PLANS]
D: IN VOLUME 2, THERE'S A LUFFY PLUSH DOLL, I MADE ONE
BASED ON IT. NOW IT'S IN MY ROOM. SO, I WISH YOU

ROOM!
D: PLEASE TAKE LUFFY AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTER
DESIGNS AND MAKE FASHION DOLLS OUT OF THEM! I'LL
DEFINITELY GET ONE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
D: PLEASE MAKE A Q¿A CORNER CALLED "LUFFY'S DISCUS-
SION CLASS"
D: PLEASE RELEASE GAIMON ISLAND'S ANIMAL ENCYCLOPE:
DIA.
D: PLEASE MAKE A SPECIAL SECTION CALLED "PIRATES'
ANALYSIS", WITH STUFF LIKE THE DETAILS OF LUFFY'S
BODY, OR THE INSIDES OF HiS PIRATE SHIP.
