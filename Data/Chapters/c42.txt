mangareader.net悶包
O: HELLO. I MIGHT AS WELL START THE SBS CORNER
NOW. STAND! BE CAREFUL!! OKAY, STAY THERE!!
D:
I HAVE AN INQUIRY, SENSE. DOESN'T THE FIRST
SS
MATE ON SHANKS' SHIP HAVE A NAME? AND ALSO,
THE MEAT GLY.
O: TAKE YOUR SEAT. OF COURSE HE HAS A NAME.
Vice-captain
Meat-Guy
AT FIRST HE WAS
• "SHOWFOCTAY NEZUM", BECAUSE HIS FACE KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE A MOUSE. THAT'S WHAT USOPP SAID. HE WAS LYING. HIS
REAL NAME IS "BENN BECKMAN". AND THE MEAT-EATING FAT GUY'S
NAME IS "LUCKY ROO". THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO REMEMBER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT SINCE I GOT ASKED ENOUGH, I MIGHT AS
WELL CLEAR IT UP.
D: I HAVE A QUESTION. I ALWAYS SEE THE SOUND EFFECT "DO~N~N" IN
ONE PIECE, BUT WHY "DO~~N'? I THINK "BABI~~~N" WOULD WORK
JUST AS WELL. (NOTE: HE ALWAYS USES DO~~N. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A
BIG DRUM SOUND, I GUESS.)
O: NO. NO GOOD. NO GOOD AT ALL. I USE "DONNN" WHEN I DRAW
SCENES TO GIVE THEM THAT "DO~~~N" KIND OF FEELING, SO IF I
DREW IN "BABI~~~N" IT WOLLD GIVE THE PICTURE A "BABI~~N"
FEELING. BUT, MAYBE IN A GAG SCENE OR SOMETHING. LIKE
"LIFU~~~N" (GIGGLE).
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
