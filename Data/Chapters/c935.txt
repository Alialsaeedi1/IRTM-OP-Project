CURRENT RATE, IT'S GOING
TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO
GATHER 5,000 PEOPLE BY THE END

BE ABLE TO GATHER 500,

THEY'RE NOT WRONG.
IF BOSS HYOUGORO OF THE

OF THE SAMURAI WOULD'VE
JOINED OUR CALISE
ALREADY.
ARE
THEY TALK-
ING ABOUT THE
MAN KANJURO
MENTIONED?
IS HE
REALLY THAT
AMAZING!?
HE
EVEN HAD
SWAY OVER THE
FIVE YAKUZA
BOSSES OF
THE OTHER
REGIONS.
20
YEARS AGO, HE
WAS THE FACE OF
WANO COUNTRY' S
UNDERWORLD.
HE WAS KIND
TO THE PEOPLE,
AND POSSESSED
BOTH POWER AND
POPULARITY. HE WAS
THE EPITOME OF
CHIVALRY
HE
WAS IN
CHARGE OF ALL
UNDERWORLD
DEALINGS IN
THE FLOWER

EVEN ODEN
ADMIRED HIM IN
HIS YOUNGER
DAYS.
V
THIS
IS A TALE
FROM 20 YEARS
AGO. ACCORDING
TO CERTAIN
RUMOURS.
...IN
THAT CASE,
IF WE CAN FIND
HIM, WE'LL BE
ABLE TO..WHAT BAD
TIMING...!! LUFFY-
DONO!! I HAVE
THE KEY YOU

SHUT
Up! I DON'T
WANNA!!
I'LL PERSONALLY
ASK KAIDOL TO

I
SAID BEFORE, IF
YOU JOIN OUR
CREW.
古古书
I NEVER THOUGHT
THE LEGENDARY
CHIVALROUS MAN
WOULD BECOME SUCH
A MALNOURISHED
GEEZER.
THIS BRINGS
BACK MEMORIES,
