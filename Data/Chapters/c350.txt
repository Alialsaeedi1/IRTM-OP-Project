daly
DON'T
WORRY
mangareader.netBUT
BEFORE
THE SEA
TRAIN,
THERE WAS
ALMOST NO
COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE
ISLANDS, DUE
TO THE ROUGH
SAILING THAT
WAS REQUIRED.
NOW, WE DON'T
EVEN NEED A
LOG AND CAN
CROSS THE SEA
AT ANY TIME.
IT'S AN
INCREDIBLE
INVENTION
1:140
WHICH
NEVER
WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF
IT HADN'T
BEEN FOR THE
WORK OF THE
GREAT SHIP
MECHANIC,
TOM!
LIKELY,
YES.
BUT IF IT GETS
TOO ROUGH HERE,
PEOPLE JUST TAKE
THE TRAIN AND
LEAVE, RIGHT?
THE INVENTION
THAT QUENCHED
ALL SUCH
UNEASINESS IS
THE SEA TRAIN,
PUFFING TOM!!
IMAGINE
THE RESIDENTS
OF THIS LONE
ISLAND, AND THINK
ABOUT HOW IT WILL
ONE DAY BE
UNDER THE SEA.
OUR
CURRENT
WELL-BEING
IS ALL DUE
TO THE
INVENTION
OF THE SEA
TRAIN.
