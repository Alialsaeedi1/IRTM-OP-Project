D: SALUTATIONS. I AM AN EARTHLIEN WHO LIVES IN THE SAME
HOUSE THAT USOPP'S FATHER'S FRIEND'S BROTHER'S
GIRLFRIEND LIVED IN A LONG TIME AGO. *AN EARTHLIEN IS
HALF-EARTHLING, HALF-ALIEN.
O: WOWWWWW. LET THE SBS BEGIN!! (DONNN)
D: THE HOURGLASSES ON BOTH SIDES OF DON KRIEG'S SKULL
AND BONES ARE SUPPOSED TO INDICATE A THREAT TO THE
ENEMY, BUT WERE HOURGLASSES REALLY USED FOR THAT
MEANING? AT THAT PERIOD IN TIME?
O: THERE REALLY WERE PIRATE FLAGS WITH HOURGLASSES ON
THEM. IT BASICALLY INDICATED THE TIME LEFT UNTIL THE
DEATH OF THEIR PREY, SO IT HOLDS A MEANING LIKE,
"IT'S
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL YOUR SURRENDER."
D:
ODA-SENSEI. SINCE LUFFY IS A GOMU HUMAN, DOES THAT
MEAN HIS "P*NIS" CAN STRETCH, TOO?
O: HIS PENIS CAN STRETCH TOO.
D: I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW MANY G/CM IS SANJI'S KICK
POWER? I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER TO TWO
DECIMALS, PLEASE.
O:
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE. YOU
KNOW THOSE GAMES AT THE ARCADE THAT MEASURE YOUR
KICK POWER? WELL, IF SANJI USED ONE OF THOSE, HE WOLLD
DESTROY NOT ONLY THE GAME, BUT THE WALL OF THE ENTIRE
BUILDING. BUT IF YOU TRIED TO PUT IT INTO A FORM OF
MEASUREMENT, I WOULD SAY 21 BATS. THE POWER TO
DESTROY 21 WOODEN BASEBALL BATS IN ONE KICK.
