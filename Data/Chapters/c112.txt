WHAT ARE THE "21 GREAT-GRADE SWORDS" AND
"GRADE-SWORDS" AND ALL THAT STUFF? ALSO, WHAT DOES
YUBASHIRI'S "UNRAVELLED EDGE WITH A SMALL T" MEAN?!
???? I'M TOTALLY LOST.
O:
AHH, WELL. YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT, MAINLY IT
WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO SOUND REALLY COOL AND IMPRESSIVE.
BUT FOR THE CURIOUS, ILL GIVE A LITTLE EXPLANATION ABOLIT
KATANAS HERE.
- THIS IS WADO ICHIMONJI, WHICH ZORO CARRIES AS A
MEMENTO OF KLINA. FOR THIS KATANA, THE "LEVEL" IS
"GREAT-GRADE SWORD", THE "MAKE" IS "WHITE-PAINTED
SCABBARD LONG SWORD" (THIS IS A TYPE OF OUTWARD
APPEARANCE FOR SWORDS. IT MEANS THE BLADE IS
PAINTED WHITE), AND THE "BLADE" IS A "STRAIGHT EDGE."
) FOR SWORDS, THE LEVELS GO DOWN
FROM SUPREME GRADE SWORDS TO
GREAT-GRADE SWORDS, SKILLFUL-GRADE
SWORDS, GRADE-SWORDS, AND THEN
NORMAL SWORDS. A GRADE-SWORD MEANS
IT'S AN EXCELLENT BLADE, WHEN THEY SAY
"12 SUPREME-GRADE SWORDS," IT MEANS
THERE ARE 12 BLADES IN THE WORLD THAT
ARE CONSIDERED THE VERY BEST.
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF BLADE EDGES:
"STRAIGHT EDGE" AND "UNRAVELLED EDGE."
THESE ARE TYPES OF
PATTERNS YOU CAN MAKE
ON THE BLADES WHEN YOU
FORGE THEM. BUT SINCE
UNRAVELLED EDGES COME IN
VARIOUS FORMS, THEY TURN
INTO AN "UNRAVELLED EDGE
