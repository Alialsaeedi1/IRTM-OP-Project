THEY
PROMISED
THEY'D BE
BACK IN 2-3
YEARS,
YOL IDIOT,
THIS IS THE
GRAND LINE.
BUT TO
THINK IT'S
BEEN WAITING
HERE FOR 50

/areader.netHE'S AFRAID
OF LOSING THE
MEANING BEHIND
HIS WAITING
ABOVE ALL ELSE
THAT HE
REFUSES

THAT'S
EXACTLY IT..
IT'S BECAUSE
HE'LL LOSE
ALL REASON,
EVEN THOUGH
THERE'S NO
POINT IN WAITING
ANYMORE..
WHAT
WHALE..
HE
STILL KEEPS ON
WAITING EVEN
AFTER BEING
BETRAYED.

THAT'S WHY HIS
ONLY HOPE,
THIS WHALE'S HOME
IS BACK IN WEST BLUE
WHICH IS LOCATED ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF
RED LINE.
ARE THE VERY
FRIENDS HE CAME
ALONG WITH HERE
IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR HIM TO
GO BACK.
LOOK AT THE
SCARS ON HIS
HEAD..
SO WHY DON'T
YOL JUST LEAVE
THE WHALE BE

YOU'VE ALSO
BEEN BETRAYED

SO
THEY JUST
ABANDONED
THE WHALE

A PLACE
WHERE COMMON
SENSE FAILS TO
lPHOLD.
AND THUS LEFT
GRAND LINE TO

THOSE

MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THEIR LIVES
THAN KEEPING I
PROMISE,

BASICALLY,
I HAVE.
I'VE TOLD HIM
THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE
TRUTH, AND
NOTHING BUT
THE TRUTH.
THIS
WHALE

STAND

IF THAT'S
THE CASE,
THEN WHY
HAVEN'T YOU
TRIED TELLING
THE WHALE
THE TRUTH?
BUT HE
REFUSES
TO LISTEN.
ThetTHE TRUTH IS
FAR MORE CRUEL,
HOWEVER.
CAN'T YOu
EVEN APPRECIATE
SUCH A MOVING
STORY ABOUT A
WHALE WHO STILL
BELIEVES IN

SO THEY JUST LEFT
THE WHALE BEHIND!?
YES..
A PLACE
WHERE THE
SEASONS, CLIMATE,
CURRENTS, AND
WINDS COLLD NOT
BE ANY MORE
CHAOTIC.
THAT IS
WHY I DO
NOT KNOW
WHETHER
THEY
SURVIVED
OR NOT.
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
THEY LEFT GRAND LINE
THROUGH CALM BELT..TRUE INDEED, MR. 9.
