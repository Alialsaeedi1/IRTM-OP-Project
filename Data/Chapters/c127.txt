"KAAAAH," CRIED THE NINJA AND
SUDDENLY! THE OLDER KIDS
WERE COMPLETELY FROZEN IN
THEIR TRACKS! THAT WAS THE
FAMOUS "PARALYSIS-INDUCTION
ARTS" AFTER THAT, HE EVEN
STOPPED A PERSON'S HEART
AND SHOWED US PICTURES
OF HIS TRAINING DAYS. THE
THRILLS DIDN'T STOP COMING.
THE NINJA THEN WENT ON TO
SAY, "YOU KNOW, I CAN STAND
UPSIDE-DOWN FROM THIS
GYMNASIUM CEILING BUT I
WON'T BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TIME TO SPARE.
SO YOU SEE, I INDEED
SAW A NINJA. I AM

DON'T HESITATE TO ASK!

WOW! KNOWLEDGEABLE HIMEKO KNOWS A LOT!! OKAY, THEN I HAVE A
QUESTION FOR YOU, KNOWLEDGEABLE HIMEKO. WHY IS IT THAT ON P.51
OF VOLUME 1, IN AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SCENE, THAT THE THREE
LINES ON SHANKS' PIRATE FLAG WERE FORG...NOT THERE? WAS IT TOO
MUCH OF A PAIN TO... IS THERE A DEEP REASON WHY IT WASN'T
REDRAWN DESPITE ALL THE READERS POINTING IT OUT? OH, I GOT IT!!
IT'S A MESSAGE TO ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS SAYING TO GO OUT ON
A VOYAGE TO HEAL THOSE THREE SCARS!! RIGHT?! NO, I'M SORRY. I
