ALWAYS LOOKING FOR PANDAMAN, BUT WHO'S
THIS GUY THAT'S ALWAYS BY HIM? AND WHAT'S
THAT HE'S ALWAYS HOLDING IN HIS HAND?
0 : EH? WHO'S THAT GUY? HE'S THE TOMATO GANG,
DUH. YEAH, THAT'S THE TOMATO GANG. THERE'S
NO OTHER ANSWER. HE'S A COLLECTOR. HE'S
GOING TO CONTINUE CHASING PANDAMAN LINTIL
HE PAYS FOR THE DEBT HE OWES. HE'S HOLDING
SOMETHING LIKE A GUN IN HIS HAND. THERE ARE
RUMORS THAT'RE GOING AROUND THAT HE'S
ACTUALLY A KELP.
