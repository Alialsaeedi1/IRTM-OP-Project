D: Watch closely Oda! This is the entire Yonkou group! (instinet) YOU'D BETTER PUBLISH IT!
A
P.. Mammoth shrine's little brother
ArRA
Ert°
O: ./ published it... but what am I supposed to do... My only choice is to
ignore..
D: dear Odacchi, ah, just because I wrote in english doesn't mean I'm a foreigner,
just in case. By the way, when I was watching TV, they were talking about this
place called the "BERMUDA TRIANGLE". Could it be that the "Florian
Triangle" was taken from here? from Below Street
O: Well, obviously, yes. Is this too vague? The Bermuda Triangle
is a place that actually exists in the North Atlantic known as N9
the "Zone of Demonic Triangle". I'm not sure about now, but in the past, it was said
that every year about 100 or more vessels suddenly disappeared in the scary area.
Since the mystery is still unsolved, I'm guess there probably still are many accidents.
As for the reasons, there's stuff like electrical problems or methane gas myths
and so on forever, so interested people can look it up. There are lots of ghost ship
witness stories too.
D: It automatically came to me when I watched the movie "STRONG WORLD". Why there was
one place in the dangerous island of Rusukania that was completely safe. The tree in the
background is the critical point, correct? Still, the tree in the movie called aft Green is probably
not the exact same species, so YOU ARE ALLOWED TO explain to the core here,
you know? P.N. TAKAAKI.T
O: As you have noticed. I figured it wasn't worth explaining because I
didn't have enough pages anyway and skipped it all, but when I made
the movie storyline, I presented the tree called Daft Green. This is
a tree that emits an odor that animals dislike (poison), which explains
why they never approach this tree, and so l used it here too. Still,
the species is not exactly the same and the setting is "same shape:
no poison emitted*
