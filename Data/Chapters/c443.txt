OTE: YOMI-GAERU IS THE VERB FOR RESURRECT
IN SHORT, THE YOMI-
YOMI NO MI DEVIL FRUIT
HAS THE POWER OF REVIVAL.
I WAS PROMISED THAT I
COULD LIVE A SECOND TIME
AS A "REVIVED HUMAN"
CHT
HAA
FIRST, CLEAN
YOUR FACE.
HOW CAN YOU
BE SO DIRTY
AFTER EATING?
THE
TRUTH IS, I
ALREADY DIED
SOME DECADES
AGO!
THAT'S
RIGHT!
CHS
OH, HOW
WONDERFUL
THAT ABILITY
SEEMED!
CHrI
HRA
UNLUCKILY.
WE HAPPENED
TO ENGAGE WITH
SOME FRIGHTENINGLY
STRONG FELLOWS
AND MY ENTIRE CREW
WAS ANNIHILATED.
WANT ME
TO HIT SOME
MANNERS
IN YOU?
OH.
EXCUSE
ME,
BURP!
I WAS A
PIRATE IN
THOSE OLD
TIMES.
OF COLIRSE,
I ALSO
DIED AT
THAT TIME!
ON
THE SHIP
YOU SAW
EARLIER,
WHEN I WAS
ALIVE, THE ONLY
ABILITY THE YOMI-YOMI
GAVE ME WAS THE
INABILITY TO SWIM.
OH,
EXCUSE
ME,
BURP!
I CAME TO
THIS "DEVIL'S
SEA" ALONG
WITH MY
NAKAMA.

I'M GLAD
IT'S JUST
A DREAM!
HE'S
FUNNY
SO I
MADE
HIM OUR
NAKAMA.
LET'S
GO INSIDE
THE SHIP
THERE'S NO
REASON FOR A
SKELETON TO TALK.

AFRO!! THIS IS A
DREAM, IT'S JUST
A DREAM!!
IT'S

WHY DO YOU
THINK YOU
WENT WITH
HIM!?
WE'RE
ASHAMED.BUT, AS YOU
CAN SEE, THERE
IS A THICK FOG
ON THIS SEA AND
I GOT LOST.

WHATEVER.
MY SOUL WAS
RETURNED
FROM THE
UNDERWORLD!
THAT DAY, AT
LAST, THE FRUIT'S
ABILITY WAS
ACTIVATED,
WHEN I
FOUND MY
OWN BODY,
IT WAS ONLY
WHITE BONES,
MY SOUL
WANDERED
AROUND THIS
FOG FOR A
WHOLE YEAR!
GUAA
BUT
YOU'RE
STILL
CURSED,
RIGHT?
BEING RESURREC-
TED EVEN THOUGH
YOU WERE ONLY
WHITE BONES IS THE
DREADFUL POWER OF
THE DEVIL'S FRUIT.
SO THAT'S
HOW YOu
BECAME A
TALKING
SKELETON!
ONCE THE
FUNCTION OF
THE FRUIT IS
FULFILLED, THE
ONLY ABILITY
YOU HAVE IS
THE INABILITY
TO SWIM.

BEFORE MY BODY
DISAPPEARED.
