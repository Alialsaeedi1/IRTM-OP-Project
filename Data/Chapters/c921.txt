ALL-STAR
JACK
HERE'S YOUR
ANSWER
THEN
WE VE ONLY
LEFT YOU ALIVE
THIS LONG..
TE
T
TELL YOU I
DON'T KNOW
HIM.
BECAUSE
KAIDOU-SAN
WANTS YOU TO
BE HIS SUB-
ORDINATE.
WILL
YOUR ATTITUDE
CHANGE?SINCE
YOU'RE SO
YOUNG?
MY NAME IS
SHINOBU!!
IF IT WERENT
FOR NAMI-SAN
BEING HERE, MY
HEART WOULD
BE SHATTERED
ALREADV!!
I UNDER-
STAND YOUR
PAIN. YOUNG
MAN. ATTRACTIVE
OLDER WOMEN
ARE... LETHAL
WEAPONS,
AFTER ALL.
THE
TECHNIQUE
THAT I EXCEL
IN, AND MOST
BEFITTINGLY..
IS THE ART OF
BEWITCH-
MENT!!
THEIR
NAMES ARE
KAWAMATSU.
DENJIRO. AND
ASHURA
DOUJI
IN THE PAST.
THEY WERE SAMURAI
WHO SERVED LORD
ODEN JUST AS WE
DID!! THEY SHOULD
DEFINITELY STILL
BE ALIVE!lI
IN THE
PAST, I WAS
KIN'EMON'S
PROTÉGÉE.
BUT NOW,
FUFUFL...
VETERAN. KUNOICHI
SHINOBU
FU FU FU.
ISN'T IT
FINE.
NOW.
THEN EVERYONE
IS GOING TO GO TO
THEIR RESPECTIVE
AREAS UNTIL THE
TIME COMES FOR
US TO GATHER..
BUT FIRST, AND
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE MUST DISCUSS
THE THREE SAMURAI
IN PARTICULAR THAT
WE NEED TO FWD.
IF WE
CAN LOCATE
THEM, THEY'LL BE
AN ASSET WORTH
100 MEN EACH!SYMBOLISED
BY TWO FIRE
BIRDS ON TOP OF
THE HABU PIT VIPER
RESPECTIVELY!!
...AND ALSO
THE WILL OF
REBELLION,
THE WANING
CRESCENT
MOON!!
TO THOSE
WHO HAVE
THE MARK OF
A CRESCENT
MOON ON THEIR
LEFT ANKLE.
THAT MARK
IS THE WILL
OF REBELLION!
THEY ARE OUR
ALLIES!!
ZOROJURO-DONO
AND USOPACHI-DONO
ARE CURRENTLY
STATIONED IN
THE CAPITAL
AH.
THEN I GUESS
ZORO HASN'T
BEEN VERY
USEFUL
ALL RIGHT
NOW! I HAVE
DEPICTED THAT
DECISIVE DAY AND
PLACE ON THIS
PAPER.
AT
THE HABLI
PORT, WHEN
TWILIGHT COMES
ON THE NIGHT OF
THE FIRE FESTIVAL,
OUR PLAN SHALL
COMMENCE!!
WE MUST
SPREAD THESE
CARDS OUT AS
QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE.
DON'T
WORRY, THE
CITIZENS OF THE
WANO COLINTRY
WILL UNDER-
STAND THIS
MESSAGE.
HUH??
FOR
FOREIGNERS
SUCH AS YOUR-
SELVES, THAT'S THE
TIME BETWEEN 5:30
AND 6:00 PM.
THE
TWO BIRDS
SYMBOLISE
TWILIGHT.
IN ORDER
TO ENSURE
THESE CARDS
GET TO AS MANY
OF OUR ALLIES
AS POSSIBLE
I HAVE SENT
OUR FELLOW
COMRADES TO
VARIOUS PLACES
AROUND THIS
COUNTRY,
WE
DO NOT KNOW
WHERE EXACTLY
TO FIND THESE
PEOPLE.
BUT...
!!THAT IS THE
HEADQUARTERS
OF KAIDOL AND
HIS BEASTS
PIRATES
AN
ISLAND
!!
SO WE
DON'T NEED
A FULL-SCALE
SHIP TO GET
THERE.
THEY CONSIDER
KAIDOL TO BE A
WISE KING WHO
PROTECTS THIS
COUNTRY.
THE
DECISIVE
BATTLE WILL
OCCUR AT THE
DEMON ISLAND,
ONIGASHIMA.
STHE
CEONS'ATTHE
RUINS OF ODEN
CASTLE?
CHAPTER 921: SHUTENMARU
BUT
THE ISLAND
IS CLOSE ENOUGH
TO BE SEEN FROM
THIS COUNTRY'S
SHORES.
INDEED! WE
POSSESS A
SHIP THAT CAN
BE USED FOR
THIS MISSION.
DO WE HAVE
TO SAIL TO THAT
PLACE, EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE ALREADY
IN THE WANO
COUNTRY?
...OUR
DECISIVE BATTLE
WILL OCCUR DURING THE
FIRE FESTIVAL. IT IS A
GRAND FESTIVAL THAT IS
CELEBRATED ANNUALLY
BY THE RESIDENTS OF
THE CAPITAL.THE ATTIRE OF
A RUNOICHILL
THAT
1S.
WAIT
A SECOND,
KIN' EMON, IS
THIS...
REALLY
WHAT A KUNOICHI
SHOULD BE
WEARING!?
You
ALL
SHOULD
RIGHT, NOW
BE ABLE TO
THAT YOU HAVE ALL
COMPLETE YOUR BLENDED IN WITH THE
ASSIGNED
CULTURE OF THIS
MISSIONS.
COUNTRY.
YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT
LYING TO
MEl?
AT YOUR
SERVICE!
SHES
DRESSED
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENTI
SHINO-

SHE
IS A REAL
KUNOICHI.
NOW, LET'S
CALL UPON THE
PERSON WHO
WILL GUIDE
YOu.
TAP..
WHATA
TREAT!!
A REAL
KUNOICHI-
MMH..
I
WONDER IF
I'LL BE ABLE
TO CLOSE
THIS UP.
LAME.
THERE
ARE TWO
TYPES OF
KUNOICHI!!
I THOUGHT I
WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SOMEONE
WITH THEIR PANTS
ON THEIR HEAD.
BUT I WAS
WRONG.
WHAT'S UP
WITH YOUR
OUTFIT?
