mangarzader.netVIKING
THE WORD "PIRATE" MEANS "PLUNDERER OF
THE SEA".
AND
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT
THEY DO
IN
SOCIETY. BUT THAT'S
ONLY
WHEN YOU DISSECT
THE WORD
"PIRATE"
ITSELF; ACTUALLY, THERE ARE DIFFERENT
TYPES OF PIRATES ACCORDING TO THE ERA
OR TIME; AND PLACE OR LOCATION
OF THOSE TYPES, I MUST TELL YOU ALL
ABOUT ONE OF
MY FAVORITE TYPE OF
PIRATE, THEY ARE KNOWN AS THE
"VIKINGS"
北欧
<政洲>
• 送附近
^1000 YEARS AGO FROM
NOW.
THE SCANDINA-
VIAN PENINSULA WAS
ALWAYS ATTACKED BY
-英>
THESE PIRATES CALLED
VIKINGS. IF
YOU LOOK
AT THE SITUATION NOW
YOU
CAN
SAY
THAT
THEY WERE FROM NORWAY.
SWEDEN AND
DENMARK, BUT THE REASON WHY THEY ARE
CALLED
'VIKINGS' IS PRETTY SIMPLE. THEY
CALLED THEMSELVES 'VIKINGS'! WHY THEY DID
THAT IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
KNOW
WITHOUT
ASKING THEM OURSELVES. SO WE NEED TO GO
BACK 1000 YEARS FOR THAT.
