WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO LOVE THIS
CARTOON ON
TELEVISION CALLED
"LITTLE
VIKING BIKKE"
IT WAS ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF A LITTLE
BOY NAMED BIKKE WHO WASN'T STRONG, BUT
VERY SMART AND TRICKY, WHILE THE REST OF
THE CREW CONSISTED OF STRONG BUT STUPID
MEN. THEIR ADVENTURES WERE EXCITING AND
MADE ME FEEL ENVIOUS WITH GREAT FEELING.
BWAHAHAHAHA!

THE BAD GUY SVEN

IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE I LAST SAW IT AND I
(23 AT THE MOMENT) WOULD LIKE ANYONE AT
MY AGE WHO MAY KNOW IT. TO WATCH THIS
SHOW AGAIN, IF THEY WILL EVER RUN A RERUN
OF IT. BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AGAIN
MYSELF,
AND THIS CARTOON IS PROBABLY THE REASON
WHY I STARTED LIKING PIRATES.
