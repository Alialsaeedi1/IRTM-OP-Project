R: HI MR. ODA, HERE'S MY FIRST QUESTION. I READ ABOLIT
PIRATE HISTORY EVERY NOW AND THEN, SO WHAT ARE THE
ORIGINS OF THE "SUPERNOVA" ROOKIES' NAMES? IS THIS
ABOUT RIGHT?
EUSTASS "CAPTAIN" KIDD
13TH CENTURY PIRATE MONK "EUSTACE"
17TH CENTURY SCOTTISH PIRATE "WILLIAM KIDD"
X DRAKE
16TH CENTURY ENGLISH PRIVATEER "SIR FRANCIS DRAKE"
BASIL HAWKINS
SAME AS ABOVE "JOHN HAWKINS"
17TH CENTURY PIRATE SHIP'S MEDIC "BASIL RINGROSE"
CAPONE "GANG" BEGE
AGAIN SAME AS ABOVE "THOMAS CAVENDISH"
TRAFALGAR LAW
18TH CENTURY ENGLISH PIRATE "EDWARD LAW"
JEWELRY BONNEY
18TH CENTURY FEMALE PIRATE "ANNE BONNEY"
UROUGE
SCRATCHMEN APOO
16TH CENTURY ARAB PIRATES, THE BARBAROSSA
BROTHERS, "UROLGE"
19TH CENTURY CHINESE PIRATE "CHEUNG PO"
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT "KILLER," BUT IF I MADE A MISTAKE ON THE OTHER
ONES, I APOLOGIZE!!
-CHIYANMIYAN SP
O: WOW, THAT'S SUPERB! I'M VERY THANKFUL. YOU EXPLAINED IT VERY NICELY.
I JUST HAVE ONE CORRECTION - CAPONE "GANG" BEGE'S NAME IS TAKEN
FROM THE AMERICAN GANGSTER "AL CAPONE" AND THE ENGLISH PRIVATEER
WILLIAM LE SALVAGE. PLEASE THINK OF PRIVATEERS AS PEOPLE LIKE THE
SHICHIBUKAI. ALSO, KILLER'S NAME IS PRETTY FITTING. OTHER THAN THAT,
THAT'S RIGHT, THE ROOKIES' NAMES WERE PUT TOGETHER FROM THE NAMES
OF REAL PIRATES. WELL, IT'S JUST THE NAMES, BUT I'M SURE THIS WILL
RAISE THE TENSION FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE PIRATES. WELL, THAT DOES IT
FOR MY BS! ON PAGE 148, ANOTHER PROJECT IS BEGINNING!
