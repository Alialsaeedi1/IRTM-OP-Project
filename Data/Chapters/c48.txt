BOTTOM
OF THE
SEA FOR

DYING EVEN
AFTER I
WARNED YOU,
mangareader.netAND IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THAT STORM
THAT WHISKED US
AWAY,
EVEN OUR MAIN
SHIP WOULD'VE
SUNK..

EVEN WANT
TO THINK
ABOUT.

WHILE WE
STILL HAD NO
IDEA WHAT WAS
GOING ON,
OUR SHIPS

SURVIVE..
THAT HAWK-EYED
MAN WHOSE GLARE

TO KILL A MAN...!
I DON'T! I DON'T
WANT TO THINK
ABOUT HIM!

COMPLAIN
WHEN I

DURING A
THE COST OF SHIPWRECK,
ONE OF YOUR
PRECIOUS
LEGS.

TOO VALLABLE
TO GIVE TO THE
LIKES OF YOU!
YOU ARE
CERTAINLY
CORRECT TO
ASSUME THAT
I KEPT A LOG,
AND I INDEED
HAVE IT TO
THIS DAY.
YES.
RED-LEG ZEFF,
YOU'RE A MAN WHO ONCE
BRAVED THE WATERS OF
THE DEVIL'S HIDEOLT, THE
GRAND LINE ITSELF!
NOT ONLY THAT,
YOU RETURNED
WITHOUT INJURY.
COOL

PRIDE OF ME AND MY
MEN WHO BRAVELY
VENTURED GRAND
LINE TOGETHER.
