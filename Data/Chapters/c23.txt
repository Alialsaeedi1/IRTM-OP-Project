mangareader.netEVERY PIRATE
IN THIS
WORLD
WISHES TO
GET THE
TREASURE
THERE.
THE PLACE
WE'RE
GOING, THE
"GRAND
LINE" IS THE
MOST DAN-
GEROUS
PLACE IN
THE WORLD!
LET'S NOT
WORRY ABOUT
THE PROBLEM
OF FOOD AND
DRINK FIRST!
AND WE DON'T
HAVE ANY
SAKE TO DRINK
EITHER!
HOW BORING!
SO WE NEED
TO GET A
BETTER
SHIP FIRST!
THE EVIL BUNNY SAYS: REAL PIRATES DRINK RUM! (OR GROG),
BUT ODA-SENSEI (THE MANGAKA) PREFERS TO USE SAKE IN ONE PIECE
WE'RE ALSO
SHORT ON CREW
MEMBERS AND
THIS SHIP
DOESN'T HAVE
ANY EQUIPMENT
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU
THINK, WE
CAN'T POSSI-
BLY BE SAFE!
NOTE: FROM NOW ON, "THE EVIL BUNNY" WILL PROVIDE THE INFO CORNERS FOR THIS MANGA A

FIRST THING
TO DO WHEN
WE GET
THERE IS
LOOK FOR A
BETTER SHIP!
THERE'S A
VILLAGE DUE
NORTH.
WE, SHOULD
GO THERE
FIRST!
WE HAVE TO
PREPARE
FIRST, AND
PLAN FOR THE
JOURNEYS
AHEAD
OH!
WHAT DO
WE DO
THEN?
AND
EAT
SOME
MEAT!
119
mangareader.netI AM NOT
TALKING
ABOUT THE
FOOD SUP-
PLIES!
WE
DON'T
HAVE
ANY
MEAT ON
THIS
SHIP!
SFX: DO
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
ALTHOUGH UNCLE
CABBAGE GAVE
US PLENTY OF
FRUITS,
ARE WE
GOING TO
THE
"GRAND
LINE" LIKE
THIS?
WE NEED
TO PLAN
THINGS
MORE!
WHAT DO
YOu
MEAN?
118
mangareader.netIT'S
TRUE!
YOU'RE LYING!
