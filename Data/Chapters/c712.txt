Yes, of course!
What has justin bieber

He taught us to never

Dero, has anyone ever taught you anything?
Yes, i have been taught better things.
Zoro taught me that, in order to achiev
your goal, you have to work very hard.
Zeff taught me that sometimes,
it's important to prefer others to yourself
in times of need.
Ace taught how much it's
important to look after
your little brother.
And Luffy.
Luffy taught me many things
And that is to always cherish your nakamas
and care for them, because they are always there for you.
So. that was all that ilearned.
