A COOK'S HANDS ARE
HIS LIFE. I CAN'T RISK
FIGHTING WITH'EM.
BUT DON'T
WORRY, MY
FEET'LL BE
MORE THAN
ENOUGH TO
TAKE YOU
DOWN,
I'VE WON THEM
ALL WITHOUT
EVEN SO MUCH
AS A SCRATCH
ON ME!
I'M AFRAID
THAT JUST
AIN'T HAPPENING!
IN THE LAST 61
FIGHTS I'VE
BEEN IN,
YOU MAY PROTECT
YOUR HANDS IN A
FIGHT, BUT I FIGHT
WHILE PROTECTING
MY ENTIRE BODY.
NOT ONE
SINGLE DROP.
21
OR IS
THAT YOUR
POLICY?
YOU STRIKE ME
AS A RATHER
LAZY GUY.
HAH! TO BEAT
UP ALL OF'EM
USING ONLY
YOUR FEET,
LE
YOU TAKE
ME DOWN?
I'VE NEVER EVEN
LOST A SINGLE
DROP OF BLOOD I
ALL THE FIGHTS
I'VE BEEN IN

der.net臂問
D: TO MASTER El. WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?
©: 4HHHH... RIGHT NOW IT'S... 12:09 A.M.! LET'S START THE SBS CORNER!!
D:
DOES SHANKS LIKE ME?
O: I DON'T CARE!
D:
ODA-SENSEl! A LITTLE WHILE AGO, MY FRIEND CAME UP AND SAID, "I'VE
FOUND THE PERFECT DEVIL FRUIT FOR YOU," SO I WENT AHEAD AND ATE
IT. NOW IT MAY JUST BE MY MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME, BUT I GET THE
FEELING THAT ALL THE JOKES I SAY AREN'T VERY FUNNY.
O:
OHHHHHH... THAT ONE, HUH? ALL RIGHT, I'LL LAY IT ON YOU STRAIGHT.
YOU HAVE EATEN THE "SAMU SAMU FRUIT." IF YOU EAT THAT FRUIT,
NOTHING BUT BAD JOKES COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. AND TO MAKE
MATTERS WORSE, YOU CAN'T SWIM. YOU REALLY GOT THE RAW END OF
THE DEAL THERE, MY FRIEND. HA HA HA HA. LAUGH IT UP, LAUGH IT UP.
HA HA HA.
(NOTE: SAMUCI) MEANS 'COLD,' AND IS OFTEN USED WHEN SOMEONE SAYS A
BAD JOKE. KIND OF THE SAME AS WHEN A COMIC SAYS "TOUGH ALIDIENCE".)
D: IN THE FIRST VOLUME, WHEN THE BANDITS ENTER THE BAR THEY
DESTROY THE DOOR, SO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE, IT'S
REPAIRED?!
O:
THAT WAS THE WORK OF THE CARPENTER "MINATOMO-SAN." HE HAS A
SHORT TEMPER, SO HE CANNOT PASS BY A BROKEN DOOR OR
WHAT-HAVE-YOU WITHOUT REPAIRING IT. I ASSURE YOU, THIS WAS NOT
MY MISTAKE.
QUIT
LOOKIN'
AT ME.
DON'T
JOKE
AROUND,
PUNK!!
