Translation Note Page:
The title is a reference to the popular Kyoto rakugo tale
A Fox of Seven Disguises: (written tIti, aka Seven Time
Fox). The story tells of a pair of men Kiroku and Seihacht,
that accidentally incite the ire of a mystical fox-spirit
(known as a kitsune,
. Which is also the word for fox
in Japanese) while traveling to ise Shrine. In its anger.
the fox visits the pair seven more times in different
disguises to play tricks on and torment them
Anyway, thisidea of a trickster fox-spirit is
common in Japanese folktales, andis similar to the
coyote trickster god that appears in Native American
mythologies. Oda has inverted the concept here. where
Onimaru, dearly a mystical fox, takes on just one disguise
to bring for tune to Kawamatsu and his mission during his
long absence. The title is an explicit reference to this.HAA
