R: ODACCHI! ODACCHI! WOULD YOUR FATHER HAPPEN TO BE A
TAXI DRIVER? WHEN I WENT TO KYOTO, I GOT A ONE PIECE
POSTER AND A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL ART FOR THE COVER
OF VOLUME 6! I WAS INTERESTED, BUT I HAD TO STUDY
FOR EXAMS, SO I DIDN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS. THANKS. O
-JANA
O: YEAH, THAT WAS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, MY DAD. HE WAS TELLING
ME, "EI-CHAN, I'M ALWAYS ADVERTISING YOUR STUFF TO MY
RER-8
CUSTOMERS," BUT HE DID IT A LITTLE TOO MUCH, SO THE COMPANY TOLD
HIM TO REIN IT IN A LITTLE. BUT EVEN NOW, HE'S STILL DRIVING AROUND
KYOTO. IF YOU MEET HIM, TELL HIM I SAID HI.
R: FOR THE THRILLER BARK ARC, DID YOU DRAW
FROM "ADDAMS FAMILY" AND "NIGHTMARE
BEFORE CHRISTMAS" FOR INSPIRATION? I LIKE
THAT KIND OF ATMOSPHERE.
-PLATE-LOVING CINDRY-CHAN
O: YES, THAT'S RIGHT, I LOVE THOSE KINDS OF
MOVIES, TOO. TO PREPARE FOR THRILLER BARK,
I WATCHED A LOT OF ZOMBIE MOVIES THAT I HADN'T SEEN BEFORE
I DON'T REALLY LIKE SCARY THINGS IN GENERAL, AND THE ARTWORK
USES MORE BLACK THAN USUAL TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE, SO I
TRIED TO CREATE BRIGHTER AND MORE FUN ZOMBIES. WHEN YOU
WRITE ABOUT GHOULS AND CORPSES AND CURSES, IT'S COMMON
SENSE THAT YOU NEED TO GO TO A SHRINE FOR PURIFICATION, SO
OF COURSE I WENT. I'M SUPER SCARED OF CURSES
R: MR. ODA, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK
YOL...! IN VOLUME 47, PAGE 166, AND IN THE
"EPISODE OF CHOPPER" MOVIE PAMPHLET,
FRANK'S SKULL-AND-CROSSBONES DESIGNS
ARE DIFFERENT. WHY IS THAT?
南尾用失
郎
-COLA WITH LEMON
O: THEY'RE DIFFERENT...? I DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL AFTER THE FACT.
BEFORE I DREW IT IN THE COMICS, SOMEONE FROM TOLEI ANIMA-
TION CAME AND ASKED ME, "IS THIS OKAY FOR FRANKY'S MARK?"
AND I SAID "SURE," BUT THEN I TOTALLY FORGOT. WELL, NOW
THEY'RE BOTH FRANKY'S MARKS. IT'S FINE FOR HIM TO HAVE TWO!

KIDNAPPED!!
IF SHE GETS
SOLD,
.!! I SEE,
THAT'S
TRUE...THAT'S RIGHT,
UP UNTIL 200
YEARS AGO,
HISTORICALLY,
THE WORLD WAS
A BAD PLACE
FOR MERMAIDS
AND FISHMEN.
EVEN THOSE
STRONG
FISHMEN...?
HAVING
"NUMBERS" IS
A STRENGTH IN
ITSELF THAT
NOBODY CAN
STAND AGAINST.
SO, I THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE MERMAIDS
AND FISHMEN WERE
STILL DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST HERE.
200 YEARS
AGO...!?
