TERRIBLE
CURSE ON
THEM.
THE MONSTER'S
HUGE EYES WERE
ENGRAVED ON
LADY HEBIHIME
AND HER
SISTERS' BACKS.
AND THAT'S
WHY WHEN
THEY BATHE,
WE PREVENT
ANYONE FROM
COMING CLOSE
BY PUTTING
UP THESE
BARRIERS.
DO YOU
UNDER-
STAND?
YEAH!!
I UNDER-
STAND!
LADY
HEBIHIME
SURE IS
AMAZING.
THAT'S WHY THE
GORGON SISTERS
NEVER TAKE OFF
THEIR CLOTHES
WHEN THERE'S
ANYBODY AROUND.
AND SO IT'S
ALSO THE
PRIDE OF THE
KUJA AND
OUR WARRIOR
NATION.
ALL THOSE
THE CURSE.
EH!
IT'S
A CURSE
THAT THEY
RECEIVED
BY FIGHTING
BRAVELY.
SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO
DEFEAT THE
GORGON
MONSTER!
BUT WITH HER
LAST BREATH,
THE GORGON
WHEN THEY
TAKE OFF THEIR
CLOTHES AND
REVEAL THE
EYES.
n
...!! SO
THAT'S
WHY.
kangardader.netTHE GOVERNMENT
HAS ORDERED YOU
TO ASSEMBLE,
AND HAS SENT
THEM TO ESCORT
YOU, RIGHT?
AS LONG AS YOU
COOPERATE, THE
TREATY WILL BE
UPHELD. AND WITH
YOuR POWERS.
WHY
DIDN'T
YOU GO!!
YOUR
LIFE WILL
NEVER BE
IN DANGER.
you
MUST GO

JuST LIKE A Puppy C
ELDER
NYON..
NOW'S
NOT THE
TIME FOR
THAT!!
THAT SHIP
HAS COME
TO RETRIEVE
YOu. AM I
WRONG?
YES, IT IS
AN INVITATION
TO WAR...
But.THE ONLY
REASON YOU
WERE ACCEPTED
BACK WAS
BECAUSE THE
PREVIOUS
EMPRESS
SHOWED YOU
MERCY.
AND THEN YOU
SHAMELESSLY
CAME BACK.
ABANDONED
THIS COUNTRY
AND WENT OLIT
TO SEA!!!
YOU'RE A
TRAITOR TO
THE KUJA
WHO, WHILE
YOU WERE
THE EMPRESS,
THeN you
JUST GO ON
LAVING THAT
WAY...
THAT'S WHY
I LIVE BY
MYSELF ON THE
OUTSKIRTS OF
THE VILLAGE!!
I AM THE
EMPRESS NOW,
AND YOU HAVE
NO RIGHT TO
SPEAK TO MElI
OW OW

HEBIHIME…. I'M
GLAD THAT I
SPOKE WITH
You!!
不分
BUT, I CANNOT
HELP BUT
ADMIRE YOUR
PASSION.
LADY

R: Oda, here's My question! In a BS soMewhere, you said that
One Piece's release schedule went like two Months, two Months,
three months, right? But then. you know…… How come lately, it's
been more like three months, three months? Is there soMe
situation on your end7 Was it just too muCh trouble? Please
answer Me! If you don't, I'll burn all of your adult books! They'll
all torn to ash! Are you okay with that?
dL
-SYOUYA
O: It's research material! Just research materials...! Well, it kinda is, 50
I won't hide it. It's true that three month intervals have been pretty
CoMMon lately. The reason is that I ask Jump for soMe time off every
now and then (but while I'm on break in Jump, I'm doing other work), s0
the number of chapters released in two Months usually isn't enough for
an entire book. From now on, you should think of the release schedule as
three months, and occasionally two Months. Also, I'd like to tell you one
More thing. I said that I'd try to put in a sBS up through the eleventh
Chapter in a book, but I don't think I'll be able to. I think it was with the
previous volume that all of Jump Comics' books have gotten 20 yen more
expensive. All the old volumes are getting 20 yen more expensive too,
so it's not really a service any more. So from now on, there will only be
up to ten chapters of SS. Thanks!
R: Oda!! I've found you. *4 In volUMe 52, page 39, in the
second panel, one of the slaves who's rejoicing over being
Preed is the pirate who bit his tongue in volume 51 and lost
consciousness, Rakyuuba!! What's more, he looked totally
Pine!!! What's More and more, his tongue isn't even cut!!!
When I saw that, I was surprised, but he looked happy, 50
I was glad too.
-Trafalgar ToMo
O: Yup, it's great that he didn't die. But if you bite through your
tongue, you really will die, so be careful!
