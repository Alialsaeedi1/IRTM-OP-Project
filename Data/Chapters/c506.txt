CROCUS SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT
WANTING TO FIND A
CERTAIN PIRATE
CREW WHEN HE AGREED
TO JOIN US..
SINCE HE WAS ABLE
TO MEET YOU GUYS,
THEN HE HASN'T KICKED
THE BUCKET JUST YET
HUH! HE WAS ALWAYS
SO FOND OF WHALES...
C.…CROCUS
TO THINK
YOU'D GO THAT
FAR FOR US!
SO...WHAT
HAPPENED
AFTER YOU
CONQUERED
THE OCEANS?
AT THIS AGE
I'D LIKE TO SEE
HIM AGAIN...
EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS ONLY
WITH THE CREW
FOR 3 YEARS,
HE WAS
DEFINITELY
ONE OF US...
IT WASNT JUST THAT HE WAS
CALLED THE "PIRATE KING"
BECAME KNOWN
WORLDWIDE AS THE
"PIRATE KING"
THAT WAS
WHEN ROGER
angareadernetBUT ROGER WAS
HAPPY ABOUT IT
HE ENJOYED IT,
SAW IT AS A
WAY TO WORK OUT
A PLAN FOR THE
UNFORESEEABLE
FUTURE.
NO ONE
KNOWS WHERE
THE MEN WHO
RISKED THEIR
LIVES WITH
HIM ARE NOW,
OR WHAT
THEY'RE
DOING...
AND ONE
YEAR AFTER
THE BREAKUP
FOR A MAN WHO
ARE MEANINGLESS.
IT WAS THE
SAME FOR
PARTYING...
FIGHTING...
HE WAS A MAN
WHO LOVED TO DO
ANYTHING AND
EVERYTHING WITH
FLAIR AND POMP..
IN THE END
AT HIS ORDERS,
THE JOLLY ROGER
PIRATES
WERE SECRETLY
DISBANDED.
ONE AFTER THE
OTHER, THEY
DISAPPEARED...

mangareader.netCROCUS OF THE
TWIN CAPES WAS
THE ONLY MAN WHO
WAS ABLE TO EASE
THE SUFFERING OF
ROGER.
AN INCURABLE DISEASE
THAT NO ONE COULD DO
ANYTHING ABOUT..
EVEN THE MIGHTY ROGER
SUFFERED FROM THAT.
WE ASKED HIM
TO ACCOMPANY US ON
OUR LAST VOYAGE,
AS SHIP DOCTOR,
AT THAT TIME
A DOCTOR, WHO ALSO
HAPPENED TO BE THE
LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER
OF THE TALLEST
LIGHTHOUSE IN
ALL THE OCEANS,
WE WERE
ABLE TO DO THE
IMPOSSIBLE,
AND FINALLY,
AFTER 3 YEARS,
AND CONQUER
THE "GRAND LINE",
WHILE
HOLDING OFF
ROGER'S
DEATH,
COME TO
THINK OF IT
HE DID SAY HE
WAS A SHIP'S
DOCTOR FOR
A FEW YEARS.
WHAAAAAT~~?
HE WAS
THAT OLD DUDE
ACTUALLY PART
WAS AT THE
OF THE PIRATE
LIGHTHOUSE
KING'S CREW?!
FOR 50 YEARS,
WASN'T HE?
THE TWIN
CAPES..HOW
NOSTALGIC!
(......
(ROCUS!?
SO HE WAS A
PIRATE FOR THOSE
3 YEARS THEN, RIGHT?
der.netEHHHHH?!
SHANKS WAS
ON THE PIRATE
KING'S SHIP?!
BOTH OF THEM
APPRENTICED
ON OUR SHIP.
BUGGY-
IF WE'RE
TALKING EAST BLUE,
THEN YOU GUYS
MUST KNOW A
PIRATE NAMED
BUGGY, RIGHT?
DO YOU HAVE
TROUBLE
HEARING?
WHEN I ASKED
HIM WHAT HAPPENED
HE SMILED AND STARTED
TALKING ABOUT YOU...
MMPH
HE WAS
MISSING HIS
TRADEMARK
STRAW HAT...
AND AN
ARM.
ABOUT 10 YEARS
AGO, I RAN INTO
HIM ON THIS
ISLAND.
MASTER
RAYLEIGH
I WAS REALLY
SURPRISED!!
THERE WAS A KID
WHO SAID THE SAME
THINGS AS CAPTAIN
ROGER...
OVER IN
EAST BLUE.
THOSE WORDS,
THAT THE
CAPTAIN ONCE
SAID...IT'S
DEFINITELY
A NAME
EVERYONE'S
HEARD AT
LEAST ONCE.
HEIS IN
ALL THE BOOKS
TOO.
I KNOW
THAT NAME
SO WELL-.
AH, SO
YOU DIDNT
NOTICE?
HE SAVED THIS
MAN'S LIFE, THOUGH
HE WAS ONLY A
CHILD AT THE TIME.
BACK 2O YEARS
AGO, WHEN I WAS
SHIPWRECKED OUT
AT SEA, HACHI CAME
AND SAVED ME.
HOW'S AN
OCTOPUS GET
IN WITH A BIG
SHOT LIKE
YOURSELF?
GOLD ROGER
BACK THEN THERE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A ROOKIE BY THAT
NAME, THERE MIGHT
NOT HAVE BEEN...
YOU MEAN
ARLONG,
RIGHT?
SINCE THEN,
UP UNTIL HE JOINED
THE SUNNY PIRATE
GANG, WE GOT TO
BE GOOD FRIENDS.
BEANS.
BEANS,
LOVE
EM...
EVERYONE
WAS CAPTURED
BY THE MARINES,
RIGHT?
STILL, EVEN
THOUGH GOLD ROGER
WAS EXECUTED 22
YEARS AGO,
HOW COME YOU.

STILL HAVE YOUR
HEAD ATTACHED
TO YOUR NECK...

TAKEN TO THE TOWN
WHERE HE WAS BORN,
LOGUE TOWN
IN EAST BLUE,
WHERE HIS PUBLIC
EXECUTION WAS
ANNOUNCED.
"I AIN'T

LAST WORDS
WERE TO ME
BUT ROGER'S
WORDS, BEFORE
HIS DEATH,
THEY HAD
PLANNED THE PUBLIC
EXECUTION TO BE A
WARNING TO ALL
OTHER PIRATES,
THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT,
THE MARINES.
