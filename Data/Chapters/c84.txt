O: DAAAHH!!!! OH...! THEY'RE PLAYING WITH ME.
(NOTE: THIS CHANT, "ONE, TWO, THREE, DAAAAH," IS THE CALL OF LEGENDARY WRESTLER ANTONIO INOKI.)
D: YO! 'SUP. ONE PIECE IS ALWAYS A HURRICANE OF EMOTION. THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME I EVER WROTE TO A MANGA ARTIST. ODA-SENSEI IS
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER.
O: I AIN'T NO CHARACTER.
D: A LITTLE WHILE AGO, MY FRIEND ASKED ME TO DRAW SHANKS, SO I
DID. THEN HE HIT ME ON THE HEAD ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND SAID,
"WHY'D YOU DRAW JANGO?!" IS THIS A DISEASE?
O: YES. IT IS A DISEASE. "DRAWING JANGO SICKNESS," I BELIEVE. YOU'RE
ALWAYS GOING TO DRAW JANGO. BE CAREFUL, AS THE FINAL SYMPTOM
OF THIS DISEASE IS WHEN YOU DRAW JANGO RATHER THAN SIGNING
YOUR NAME FOR A HOME DELIVERY.
D: ON P. 121 IN VOLUME 8, THAT THING THAT RISES ABOVE ZEFF'S HEAD
IS A HAT, RIGHT? MY MOTHER SAYS, "IT'S TOO TALL TO BE A HAT.
THERE MUST BE A POLE BEHIND HIM OR SOMETHING." SENSEI,
PLEASE MAKE THIS BLOCKHEAD (44) AGREE WITH ME.
O:
OKAY, MOM, LISTEN TO ME NOW. IN THIS WORLD, THERE ARE CERTAIN
UNYIELDING TRUTHS THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT AVERT YOUR EYES FROM.
THE THING THAT IS STANDING ON ZEFF'S HEAD IS A "TOWER OF FAITH,"
SUPPORTED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE HEART. YES, IT'S CALLED THE
"COOK'S SLICE OF HEAVEN HAT." THAT'S RIGHT!!!
