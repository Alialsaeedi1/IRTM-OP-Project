ADVENTURES OF THE BUGGY CREW VOL. 9 "YOL'RE A STRANGE BEAST TOO"
mangareader.netD:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KEY SHUSHU SWALLOWED IN VOLUME 2?
O: IT CAME OUT. SHINY AND BROWN.
D:
WHEN I WAS READING THE SBS CORNER IN VOLUME 4, YOU SAID
LUFFY'S ARM COULD STRETCH ABOUT 72 GOMU GOMUS, BUT I WAS
WONDERING, JUST HOW MANY LITERS IS 1 'GOMU GOMU'? (I CHECKED
WITH THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION)
O:
OH, YOU AGAIN! SON OF GAIMON-SAN. AND YOU LOOKED AT THE
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AGAIN... LITERS, WELL... YOU CAN'T PUT IT
THOSE TERMS, YOU SEE? OKAY? 1 'GOMU GOMU' IS ABOLIT 10 'MERCHEN
GOMU GOMUS'. (MERCHEN IS A GERMAN WORD MEANING FAIRY TALE.)
1 'MERCHEN GOMU GOMU' IS ABOUT 10 'FUNKY GOMU GOMUS', SO
LUFFY'S ARM CAN STRETCH ABOUT 7200 'FUNKY GOMU GOMUS'. GOT
IT?
D:
WHERE ARE YOU FROM, SENSE? IT WASN'T IN YOUR PROFILE IN
VOLUME 4.
O: FROM KUMAMOTO. FROM KYUSHU. FROM A WONDERFUL PLACE.
D: WHY DON'T LUFFY AND ZORO GO BY THE NAMES "MONKEY" OR
"RORONOA"? OR ARE THOSE THEIR FAMILY NAMES, THE JAPANESE
WAY?
O: YES. THAT'S IT. FIRST FAMILY NAME. THEN PERSONAL NAME.
D: IS THERE A MIRROR ON ALBIDA'S SHIP?
O: WHOA! HEY, HEY... SHE'S GONNA THROW THAT CLUB AT ME! DON'T ASK
ME! MAN, WHAT A DANGEROUS QUESTION. SOMETHING TELLS ME THERE
IS NO MIRROR. DONK!!! WHOA, SHE THREW SOMETHING!!
D: WHEN YOU READ ONE PIECE, SOME MYSTERIOUS CHARACTERS SHOW
LIP FROM TIME TO TIME. LIKE, IN ONE PIECE VOLLIME 5, PAGE 128, IN THE
THIRD PANEL, THERE'S AN ODD GUY IN THE BACK. WHO IS HE? I'M SO
INTERESTED, I'M NOT BRUSHING MY TEETH.
O: NO, BRUSH YOUR TEETH. DENTISTS ARE SCARY. 50.
... YOU FOUND HIM
HE IS A WRESTLER NAMED "PANDAMAN", I WILL INTRODUCE HIM TO YOU
SOME TIME LATER.
