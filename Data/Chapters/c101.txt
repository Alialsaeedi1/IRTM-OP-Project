mangareader.netSINCE WE'RE

WE'LL CRASH

NO BUT I'VE
HEARD THINGS

ABOLIT THE

THEN
THEY WOULD

REVERSE MOUNTAIN

SO THE CURRENTS
THAT HIT ITS EDGE WILL
TRAVEL DOWN TO THE

Mangareader.netTHAT'S RIGHT,
AND THERE'S A
PERFECTLY GOOD
REASON FOR THAT.
NO WE
CAN'T!
COULDN'T

PLACE, WHY DO
WE EVEN HAVE TO
ENTER DIRECTLY
THROUGH THE

ANYWAYS?
WAIT, WHA? GuYS!

D: A QUESTION FOR SENSE. WHY DO ZORO AND SANJI AND NAMI
DRINK ALCOHOL, WHEN THEY'RE STILL MINORS? IS THAT
ALLOWED?
O: NO.
D: I USUALLY DON'T SEND THIS TYPE OF THING, BUT THIS TIME I DID.
ODA-SENSEI, I CHALLENGE YOU! AKA-TAKO-ASHI-KIKEN

TRY TO SAY THIS 3 TIMES FAST. (AND PUT IT IN THE SBS)

AHA... A TONGUE-TWISTER? PSHH, THESE ARE SO EASY... READY,
GO!!
ACHAKABATASABADARAPPA..!!!
OKAY, NEXT.
D: ODA-CHAAAAN. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK; AT THE END OF THE
BOOK, IT SAYS MAKING UNAUTHORIZED COPIES IS A COPYRIGHT
VIOLATION. BUT IS IT OKAY TO MAKE COPIES OF THE TIMETABLE
AND STUFF? PLEASE TELL ME. FROM THE THIRD OF COBY'S HAPPY
FRIENDS.
O: IT'S COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN, BUT BASICALLY, PERMISSION HAS
BEEN GRANTED IN SEVERAL PLACES FOR THAT ILLUSTRATION, SO IT'S
ALL RIGHT. ALSO, A LOT OF PEOPLE WROTE TO SAY, "MY SCHOOL
GOES FOR EIGHT PERIODS" BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN MANAGE
WORKAROUND ON THAT ONE, SORRY.
IT'S HARD TO STUDY FOR SO LONG!
