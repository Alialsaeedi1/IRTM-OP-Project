D: HEYYYYYY!! GUY WHO SAID HE LIKES NAMIIIIII!! FIGHT WITH ME!! I
LOVE NAMI 100X MORE THAN YOULLULLU. BUT I LOVE YOU
T00000000. AM I A HOM00000000O (ANGRY)? NO, WE'RE
FRIEEEEEENDS, YOU AND I ARE FRIEEEEEEEENDS.
O:
„THAT'S RIGHT. THE GUY WHO KEPT SAYING NAMI NAMI NAMI IN
VOLUME 7. GET ALONG, NOW!
D: IN AN SBS IN VOLUME 7, YOU SAID SANJI-SAN'S AGE WAS 19, BLT
AFTER DISCUSSING WITH MY FRIEND, WE ARRIVED AT THE
CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS A LIE. HOW OLD IS HE, REALLY?
O: UH, IT'S NOT QUITE LIP TO YOU TO DECIDE THAT. ALL YOLI CAN DO IS
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT... IT'S TRUE.
D: WHY DID "RED-LEG ZEFF" EAT HIS RIGHT LEG? THAT'S WHERE HIS
KICK POWER LIES, SO COULDN'T HE EAT THE LEFT ONE INSTEAD?
O: BZZZZT. WRONG. THE BASE OF YOUR KICK STRENGTH IS ACTUALLY
THE "PIVOTING LEG." FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WERE TO TRY TO KICK A
BALL WITH YOUR RIGHT LEG, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A LEFT LEG? YOU COULDN'T KICK IT, RIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU GO
ASK YOUR SOCCER-PLAYING FRIENDS? THE LIFE OF THE KICK IS
CONTAINED IN THE LEG THAT SUPPORTS YOUR WEIGHT!!
D:
ODA-SENSEI! DROP YOUR PEN! STOP DRAWING MANGA! I HAVE A
QUESTION. MY OLDER BROTHER AND I WORK TOGETHER TO BLY
THE SBS, BUT WE ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT TWO COPIES OF VOLLIME
5. WHAT SHOULD WE DO? IF YOU ANSWER ME, YOU MAY USE YOUR
PEN!
O: WELL, THEN... HOW ABOUT, "GO BLY FIVE MORE COPIES OF VOLLME
5"? THEN THE FACT THAT YOU BOUGHT TWO BEFORE WON'T REALLY
MATTER ANYMORE, AND YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT! CAN I PICK UP THE
PEN NOW?
D:
IF LUFFY WANTS A MUSICIAN SO BAD, WHY DOESN'T HE COME TO
MY HOUSE? IS IT BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE BY THE OCEAN? IS IT
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY AN ALIEN? IS IT BECAUSE MY FEET HAVE
BEEN SMELLY LATELY?
O:
IT'S BECAUSE YOUR FEET SMELL. THE SBS IS OVER!! UNTIL NEXT
VOLUME!!
