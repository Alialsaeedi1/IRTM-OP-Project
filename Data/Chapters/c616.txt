TIME AND AGAIN, HISTORY HAS
TAKEN THE WRONG PATH...
BUT NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT!!!
BAHOHOHOH!!
TODAY WILL BE THE
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR
ENGAGEMENT,
SHIRAHOSHI-
NO NEED TO RUSH
INTO THINGS; THE WEDDING
CAN WAIT UNTIL.
TOMORROW!!!
THIS WORLD IS NOT
RIGHT UNTIL ALL
FISHMEN, MERFOLK
INCLUDED, ARE ABLE
TO SEE
THINGS
EYE-TO-EYE.
...AS THE DAY
FISHMAN ISLAND
WAS UNIFIED
UNDER ONE VISION!!!
HUMANS ARE
AN INFERIOR SPECIES
WHO CANNOT EVEN
BREATHE UNDERWATER.
THEY SHOULD SUBMIT
TO OUR AUTHORITY!!!

HORDY JONES, FROM

WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU

HERE?!!!
THAT FACE...!!!
WHY, YOU ARE THE
DEPLORABLE VANDER
DECKEN!!! FINALLY
YOU SHOW YOURSELF!!
HE WAS
ONCE.
A SKILLED
WARRIOR IN
OUR VERY
OWN NEPTUNE
ARMY...
BUT WHY
IGHE
?!!
angareaderAND BESIDES.
SHIRAHOSHI IS
AS LARGE AS I!
SHE COULD HARDLY
LEAVE WITHOUT
ANYONE
NOTICING!!!
NEVERTHELESS,
SHE WOULD NEVER
LEAVE THE PALACE
OF HER OWN
ACCORD!!
BUT I SAW NO
SIGN OF ANYONE
RESEMBLING A
MERMAID PRINCESS!
CERTAINLY, IT IS TRUE
THAT LUFFY-SAN AND
THE SHARK CAME
OUT OF THAT ROOM.

EH?! THE
MERMAID PRINCESS
IS HUGE?! HOW
OUTRAGEOUS!!

AT ANY RATE..../ OUR CAPTAIN
WOULD NEVER KIDNAP

SUSPICIONS ELSEWHERE,
GOT THAT?!!
THIS IS HARDLY
THE TIME FOR
SUCH SILLY
JOKES, YOUR
MAJESTY!!!
I KNOW!! PERHAPS
THE CULPRIT STUFFED
SHIRAHOSHI INSIDE
MEGALO'S MOUTH, AND
TOOK HER FROM THE
CASTLE THAT WAY?!!
Ryuuguo Palace
Entrance:
All gates open
EVEN IF SOMEBODY WERE
CRAZY ENOUGH TO THINK UP
SUCH AN IDEA, THEY WOULD
NEVER CARRY IT OUT!! THE
VERY CONCEPT IS
ABSURD!!

NO
WAY
~an!!
..I WILL NEVER BRING
YOU YOUR SHIP OR

THAT'S A VERY
HUMAN WAY OF
THINKING.
I KNOW MOST SPECIES
THAT LIVE ABOVE
THE OCEAN TEND
TO HAVE A HEAVY
RESEMBLANCE
WITHIN FAMILIES.
SO FOR INSTANCE,
IF AN OCTOPUS
MERMAID GIVES
BIRTH TO A
SHARK MERMAN..
PARENT
AND
CHILD
THAT JUST MEANS
THAT SOMEWHERE
WAY BACK ON THEIR
FAMILY TREE, THEY
HAD A SHARK MERMAN
FOR AN ANCESTOR.
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT
FOR US TO
UNDERSTAND THAT
HUMAN INSTINCT...
•THAT LEADS
YOU TO CLASSIFY
PEOPLE BASED
ON THEIR
APPEARANCES.
ELDER
BRO
RIGHT. DEN-SAN.
STILL, YOU REALLY
I THOUGHT, SINCE
DON'T LOOK MUCH
YOU'RE TOM-SAN'S
LIKE HIM, HUH...? I
BROTHER, THERE'D BE
MEAN, YOU'RE A
A LITTLE MORE
MERMAN...
AND NOT
RESEMBLANCE,
EVEN A PUFFER
YOU KNOW...
FISH..
THE
NAME'S
DEN!
BUT IT'S
A LITTLE
DIFFERENT
FOR US.
FISHMEN AND
MERFOLK CARRY
A LONG, LONG
MEMORY OF THEIR
HERITAGE IN
THEIR GENES.
(
ON FISHMAN ISLAND, IT'S
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO PREDICT WHAT A CHILD
WILL LOOK LIKE JUST
FROM LOOKING AT
THEIR PARENTS.

LITTLE AHEAD OF
YOURSELF, POPS?!!
VANDER DECKEN!!
NOW THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN
YOUR FACE HERE, THERE
CAN BE NO FURTHER DOUBT!!!
YOU ARE THE CULPRIT!!!
RETURN MY DAUGHTER
AT ONCE!!!
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH
SHIRAHOSHI?!!
YOU HAD BETTER
NOT HAVE HARMED
A HAIR ON
HER HEAD!!!
WHAT OTHER
EXPLANATION IS
THERE FOR
HER SUDDEN
DISAPPEARANCE
?!!!
DO NOT
PLAY THE
FOOL,
DECKEN!!!
WHAT'S THIS GUY
BLABBERING ABOUT...?
YOU TRYIN' TO TELL
ME SHIRAHOSHI'S
ALREADY GONE OFF
SOMEWHERE...?
BESIDES WHICH,
REGARDLESS
OF THE TRUTH OF
THESE MEN'S
WORDS..
AT THE VERY
LEAST, THAT
MEANS SHE WAS
STILL HERE WHEN
YOU LAUNCHED THE
ATTACK!!
CALM YOURSELF, DECKEN!!
TAKE A LOOK AROuND.
THE HUMANS YOU SENT
FLYING TOWARDS THE
PRINCESS HAVE ARRIVED
HERE IN THE PALACE!!
MY BELOVED
SHIRAHOSHI..
HAS
DISAPPEARED

PROPERTY
OF YOURS
YOUR
MAJESTY!!
THERE IS NO
NEED TO RISE

A TRAP?! THIS

THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT WHALES..

FOR THE MOST PLENTIFLIL
AREAS OF THE OCEAN, AND
NATURALLY GATHER THERE.

CALL A "GRAVEYARD OF SHIPS".
SUNKEN SHIPS ARE BROUGHT
HERE BY THE THE FLOW

THIS, OF ALL PLACES, WOULD
BE BLESSED WITH THE LIGHT OF
THE SUNTREE EVE, AND FILLED
WITH BEALTIFUL CORAL..
EVEN THE FISH
