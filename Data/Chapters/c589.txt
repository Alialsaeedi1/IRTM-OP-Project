D: Oddachi, I found a mistake! On volume 59, chapter 584, Luffy bleeds because of
Porchemy's gloves, right?? But but, in volume 1 chapter 2, Alvida's iron club with
the same spikies don't work on Luffy! Is this ok?? Give me something! P.N.MONIO
O: | see. It's ok. It's a slight problem we're talking about here, but look
closely. The spikes angles are different, right?!! I made this difference
in the Impel Down Demon Guards and all as well, but even if the weapons all
have the same spikes, the ones that work on Luffy have fine, sharp points,
and I make them look like they can even pierce rubber. On the other hand,
drew Alvida's iron club dull so it looks like it would only put force on rubber.
So it's ok!! I won't give you anythin-g!
D: Question out of nowhere. Is Marco's head "bananas"? Or is it a "pineapple"? and, is
Kid's head a "tulip"? Or is it a "Chrysanthymum"? I wonder. I wonder alot. from Kaho
O: ALREADY NARROWED DOWN TO 2 CHOICES?! (shock) Well, it seems like I
have to pick one or the other, so I quess if I had to choose, I would say Marco
would be a pineapple" and Kid is a Chrysanthymum.-….uh... WHAT IS THIS
CONVERSATION HERE?!
D: Some time earlier, I was watching the movie "ROCKY" and noticed this, but
the character Rocky's pet goldfish's name was to my astonishment, "Moby Dick"!!
That's the same as the Whitebeard pirates' main ship's name! Did you take
"Moby Dick" from there?? P.N.Negishi
O: "ROCKY", huh? Brings me back to the old times. It was a super hit
boxing movie. - I see, giving a goldfish this name is a pun right there.
*Moby Dick is the title of a super famous novel in America by a person
named Melville. about a white whale and one man's duel. In Japan, the
title was changed to "Hakugei". I thought it would be perfect for
Whitebeard and borrowed the name.
