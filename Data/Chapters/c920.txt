HOWEVER,
TRAVELLING TO
THE FUTURE 15
VERY POSSIBLE
IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR PEOPLE TO
TRAVEL TO THE
PAST.
NOW,
THIS MAY
SOUND HARD
TO BELIEVE,
BUT.
I'VE BEEN
TRAVELING
FURTHER AND
FURTHER INTO
THE FUTURE
USING THIS
MYSTERIOUS
"TIME-TIME"
ABILITY.
T/N: TIME-TIME = TOKI-TOKI.
THERE HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN
RUMOURS THAT
LADY TOKI WAS
BORN SOMETIME
IN THE DISTANT
PAST.
COULD
WE STOP
T.!?
.THERE-
FORE, THIS IS
WHERE I SHALL
REMAIN.
LORD
ODEN.
AND FINALLY,
I HAVE ARRIVED
HERE, AT THE
TERMINUS OF
MY JOURNEY,

OH,
IS IT NOT
TO YOUR
LIKING?
HEY, THIS
THING CAN
TALK.
WE ARE
SAVED BY THE
FACT THAT THEY DO NOT
TRULY BELIEVE OF
OUR PRESENCE
_EVEN
THOUGH OROCHI'S
TROOPS KNOW
OUR NAMES...
THEY THINK
THAT WE ARE
GHOSTS.
WHEN WE
ARRIVED AT PUNK
HAZARD... CAESAR
ANOTHER ONE OF
KAIDOL'S PAWNS,
WAS THERE!!
I WAS
"DISMANTLED" BY
LAW-DONO, WHO IS NOW
OUR ALLY..
. IT WAS
TRULY A DESPERATE
SITLIATION.
WHO
IS IT?
THINKING BACK ON IT,
WE WENT THROUGH CRISIS
AFTER CRISIS. BUT IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY A BLESSING
TO MEET ALL OF YOU.AND
BEGAN TO
PURSUE
uS.
LEAVING
THE COUNTRY IS
ALSO A CRIME. AS
WE WERE LEAVING,
THEY SPOTTED
US,
AND US
FOUR, AS YOU
ALREADY KNOW,
SET OUT TO
RECRUIT
ALLIES.
WE
ENTRUSTED
KIKU WITH
GATHERING
INTEL ON THE
ENEMIES...!!
THERE,
WE PARTED
WITH RAIZO.
BECAUSE
NONE OF US HAD
ANY NAVIGATIONAL
SKILLS, ON OUR
WAY TO ZOLl,
LET US
MEET ON
ZOU!!
WE
IMMEDIATELY
SHIPWRECKED
AND LOST OUR
VESSEL.
WE PARTED
WITH KANJURO
THERE.
BARELY ESCAPING
WITH OUR LIVES, WE
ENDED UP DRIFTING TO
DRESSROSA. THERE, WE
WERE CHASED BY
DOFLAMINGO,
DO
NOT WORRY
ABOUT ME.
SAVE YOUR-
SELVES!!!
WHO WAS
WORKING WITH
KAIDOL..
...! IN THE
PROCESS OF TRYING
TO CATCH UP TO LORD

The tale of Momotaro:
I'm sure that many people here would have come to learn about
the tale of Momotaro as the Wano arc has progressed due to
the sheer number of references. With the reveal of Onigashima,
I will list all the references within the story below.
An old couple found a giant peach floating in the river. They
open it to eat, only to find a baby boy inside. They name him
Momotaro (Peach-boy, Momonosuke). Momotaro grew up and
went to fight the Oni (demon/Kaido). On Momotaro's Journey,
he befriends a dog (Komainu), monkey (Baboon) and pheasant
(currently unknown) by giving them kibi-dango (millet
dumplings, Tamal. Momotaro, along with his animal friends,
goes to Onigashima (demon island where Kaido is) in order to
slay the Oni. They return home with the Oni's treasure and live
happily ever after.
On a side note,"
"Tama" means round/ball, which is a reference
to the roundness of Dango (japanese dumplings).
This is what Kibi-dango looks like.
And just to make it come full circle... the paradise farm (*K)lE
¾3 - tougenkyoul, which i mentioned last time, means a
paradise of never-ending peach trees, linking back to the
tale of momotaro.Chapter 920 References
The Kozuki Food Theme:
As many of you would have noticed by now, there is a recurring
food theme within the Kozuki family. Here is the full list las far
as i knowl.
This is oden.
And this is Sukiyaki.
The Kozuki family is spelt either as Kouzuki or Kozuki (A)
which means Moonlight. However, If you were to shorten the
"O" sound to be just Kozuki (although this is a stretch), it can
mean red bean (JE).
In addition, the Nine "Red Scabbards" are known as the Nine
"Akazaya" (44) which does indeed mean red
scabbards/sheaths. However, there is also a type of food called
Akazaya Mochi, which is essentially red bean paste in baked
mochi.HE DON

.THEN WE WILL
STAND BY YOUR
SIDE AND FIGHT
WHEN THE TIME
COMES!!
IF YOU
ARE WILLING
TO LEAD THE
FIGHT AGAINST
OROCHI...
.!I
WE HAD HOPE
THAT YOU WOULD
APPEAR 20 YEARS
FROM THAT
DAY.
EVEN IF
THERE WAS
A ONE IN A
MILLION
CHANCE
WE MUST
GATHER TOGETHER
IN SECRET. NOBODY
CAN KNOW OF WHAT
WE ARE PLANNING.
UNBELIEVABLE.
EVEN THOUGH 20 YEARS
HAVE PASSED, WE STILL
HAVE ALLIES WE CAN
COUNT ON.
WE ALL
HAVE TATTOOS
OF THE MARK OF THE
MOON ON OUR ANKLES,
AND SHALL WAIT FOR
YOUR COMMAND...
Il
NO
MATTER
WHERE
WE ARE,
OR WHAT
WE ARE
DOING...
rIY
WE SHALL
DO OUR
UTMOSTIIIN
DESPERATION,
WE ESCAPED WITH
ALL OF OUR
STRENGTH,
.YES...
. BUT AT
THAT POINT, NO ONE
"AS SMOKE SIDE
IT'S PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU
GUYS WERE ABLE TO
ESCAPE SAFELY FROM
SUCH A CRAPPY
SITUATION.
AND LEFT THE
EXECUTION SITE TO
HEAD TO ODEN
CASTLE.
BUT AT
THAT POINT, IT DID
NOT MATTER WHO
DIED. WE ABSOLUTELY
NEEDED TO GET TO
ODEN CASTLE.
ON OUR
WAY THERE,
NEKOMAMUSHI
AND INLARASHI
STARTED TO
ARGUE IT
OLIT.
OROCHI, WHO
ORCHESTRATED THE
DOWNFALL OF THE
KOZUKI CLAN, WOULD
SURELY TARGET LORD
MOMONOSUKE'S LIFE
NEXT.
THEY
WERE CALGHT
BY OROCHI'S
SUBORDINATES
AND WE BELIEVED
THEIR LIVES TO
BE FORFEIT.
HOW
EVER
AND THE
CASTLE WAS SET
ABLAZE BEFORE
WE COULD
REACH IT
KAIDOU
ANTICIPATED
OUR PLAN,LORD ODEN HAD
A HABIT OF SAYING
THIS ONE THING:
"T$ 100
CRAMPED
HERE!
WHERE IN THE
WORLD DID THEY
WANDER OFF
TO.
I'M
AMAZED
THAT THEY
COULD GET LOST
EVEN WHILE I WAS
RIDING ON THAT

I SHOULD

... JEEZ,
THOSE
GuYS.
31380,SO THE
TALES OF
LADY TOKI'S
POWERS..
WERE ALL
TRUE.
20 YEARS
AFTER THAT
INCIDENT!!
WE TRAVELLED
AROUND THE WANO
COUNTRY IN ORDER TO
BETTER UNDERSTAND
ITS CURRENT STATE.
loll
WORN OUT
GRAVES.
WHERE
If MY
MOTHER?!
TELL ME
KIN'EMON!!
WE'VE
LANDED IN
THE WANO
COUNTRY.
...WE WERE
TRULY IN AN
UNKNOWN
WORLD.THAT IS
WHAT THE
PEOPLE OF KURI
CALLED THE
CASTLE THAT
ONCE STOOD
HERE.
BUT
ACTUALLY,
ITS REAL NAME
WAS... KURI
CASTLE.
THAT'S
RIGHT!!
SO THAT
WAS MOMO'S
FATHER!
HE GOT INTO
VIOLENT FIGHTS ONE
AFTER THE OTHER... AND
WAS EVENTUALLY EXILED
FROM THE FLOWER
CAPITAL!!
A WHAT.
...HOWEVER,
AT THE TIME, THERE
WAS A PLACE IN THE
WANO COUNTRY THAT
WAS CONSIDERED
A LAWLESS
AREA.
THIS
PLACE WAS
CALLED ODEN
CASTLE.
WANO
COUNTRY-
KURI-THE
RUINS OF
ODEN
CASTLE
TRiNEMON
RECALLS THE
5 PAST.
THE
CASTLE WAS
CALLED AS
SUCH.
ODEN WAS
BELOVED BY
THE RESIDENTS
OF KURI. AND
THEREFORE,
OUR
MASTER,
LORD ODEN,
WAS QUITE THE
WILDCARD.
DESPITE BEING
THE SON OF WANO
COUNTRY'S SHOGUN,
LORD KOUZUKI
SUKIYAKI.THAT WAS
KURI.
IT WAS SUCH A
HEINOUS PLACE, THAT
EVEN THE SHOGUN
DECIDED TO IGNORE
ITS PROBLEMS.
AND FORMED
CRIMINALS
GROUPS TO ROB
AND RONIN EXILED
AND KILL. EACH DAY, FROM THEIR VILLAGE
BLOOD WAS
WANDERED ABOLIT
SPILLED.
THERE.
WHO WAS
CONSIDERED THE
MOST DANGEROUS
MAN OUT OF ALL
THE EVILDOERS IN
THIS LAND. IN THE
END. LORD ODEN
DEFEATED HIM.
AND
STARTED A
HUGE FIGHT WITH
A MAN KNOWN
AS ASHURA
DouJI.
123002
WENT
TO THAT
KURI, OF ALL
PLACES.
THE
YOUNG LORD
ODEN.
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS, HE
ROUNDED UP THE
RUFFIANS IN THIS
LAND, AND RAISED
THEM FROM THEIR
PITIFUL BAD
DEEDS..
AFTER SOME
TIME, SHOGUN
SUKIYAKI HEARD OF
HIS DEEDS.
HE
FORCED THEM TO
LEARN HOW TO BE
WORKERS, AS IT WAS
A NECESSITY FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS
TOWN AND THE
CASTLE.
IT WAS
THEN THAT HE WAS
BESTOWED THE TITLE OF
DAIMYO OF KURI... AT THE
YOUNG AGE OF 20..
IT
WAS A MONUMENTAL
ACHIEVEMENT FOR
LORD ODEN.
HE BUILT
A PARADISE
FARM FOR THE
SAKE OF EVERYONE...
AND CREATED A FREE AND
LIVELY VILLAGE WHERE THE
SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER
WOULD NOT STOP.THE KOZUKI
NAME WAS
SCORNED.
THE DAIMYO
AND VILLAGE
GONE, AND THE
VAST WASTE-
LAND...
UNDRINK-
BY THOSE IN
POWER
THERE WERE
FACTORIES LINED
UP, ROW BY ROW
COUNTLESS SMOKE.
STREAMS RISING
INTO THE AIR.
WE WERE
WRONG.
WE THOUGHT
WE WOULD BE
UNABLE TO FIND
PEOPLE TO FIGHT
ALONGSIDE US.
BUT..
.WE
REALIZED
THAT THIS WAS
NO LONGER THE
WANO COUNTRY
WE ONCE
KNEW
20 YEARS,
I HAVE BEEN
WAITING HERE
FOR 20 YEARS
!!
I AM
JIBL'EMON OF
THE RUNERFORMER
SHOGUN!!
YOU
ARE LORD
KOZUKI MOMONO.
SUKE, IS THAT
CORRECT?
I
BELIEVED
LADY TOKI'S
WORDS... AND
WAITED HERE
FOR THIS
DAY!!THE MOST
IMPORTANT
PART OF THIS
PLAN IS TO NOT
BE EXPOSED,
AND HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO
RENTER THE
COUNTRY WITHOUT
ANYONE SUSPECT-
ING A THING.
THANKS TO
THAT, WE HAVEN'T
BEEN PUT ON
ANY WANTED
POSTERS,
EVEN I DIDN'T
REALIZE IT. AND
I'M ONE OF YOUR
ALLIES...!!

LITTLE BIT TOO
CRAMPED.
