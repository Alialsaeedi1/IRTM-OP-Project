Kare-San-Sui(枯散衰)：
Kare-san-sui (literally dry-mountain-water) are Japanese Rock Gardens or
Zen Gardens. Often seen in monasteries, these gardens are made to imitate the
essence/ flow of nature which aids in meditation.
An example of a Japanese Rock Garden.
Shinobu's ninja art Kare-san-sui (th#XE2) however, is spelt differently and
literally translates into dry-scattering-decay, putting an emphasis on her
rottin-…. I mean, uh.…. maturing abilities.Chapter 933 References
Vamata no Orochi (几岐大蛇)：
The Yamata no Orochi is a famous Japanese mythical serpent with eight heads
and eight tails. It is said that the Yamata no Orochi is so big that it's body covers
the distance of eight valleys and eight hills. There is a very famous story about the
Orochi that you can search up if you would like to have a read. (This story also has
references to Susano-o and Kushinadal.
Fuujin (EL*]) & Raijin (AR 7]):
Fuujin (E 74) is the Japanese God of Wind, while Raijin (#5 74) is the japanese God
of Thunder. Oda has cleverly swapped out god (74) for blade (*J), to match their
Ninja theme.
This is the famous artwork Fujin-raijin-zu which depicts the two gods. (If you play
Pokemon, you may recognise them as Tornadus and Thundurus)HEEEEY, DI

TIME UNTIL
THE FINAL
BATTLE:In Regards to The Previous Chapter
There have been a few comments made about us using the word "prostitute" to describe
Komurasaki, so we thought we'd clear the confusion up.
Since Komurasaki's introduction, she has been referred as both a Yuujo (7 K) and an
Oiran (TErtE).
For a bit of background, a Yuujo (literally "play girl") are prostitutes/pleasure women who
live in brothels in the pleasure districts. Oiran (courtesans) are high-ranking yvujo that
provide a variety of entertainment to their guests. Different from normal yuujo that only
provide sex, Oiran are trained to be able to to play instruments, sing, dance, draw, etc. in
order to entertain customers. However, it is important to note that providing intimate
services to their guests in exchange for money is still their primary source of income. And
although Oran are high-ranking, the majority of them do not get to select their guests or
what service to provide. Only the higher-ranked oirans such as the Koshi and Tayuu/Dayuu
were able to select their customers.
Now back to the topic of translating these terms. We understand that One Piece is a
manga where every word counts. So our top priority when translating One Piece has
always been and will always be accuracy, followed by flow of speech. We have no
obligation to censor our translation. Especially in this case, Oda has made it clear that he
wants us to know that Komurasaki is a Yuujo. Otherwise he would have censored it himself
by omitting the word Yuujo completely and simply just labelled Komurasaki as an Oiran.
To sum it up, we will always translate if & (yuujo) as Prostitute and TE/Lloiran) as
Courtesan. We will NEVER interchange them randomly as these words have powertul
nuances and are crucial in setting the mood of a scene.
