Yakuza:
Yakuza, also known as Gokudo, are traditional organised crime
syndicates in Japan. A group of Yakuza is commonly known as a
"family". The leader of the group is called the "Oyabun (foster parent)"
and the subordinates are known as "Kobun (foster children)". One piece
has used this concept in the past when the strawhat grand fleet was
formed. Kyoshiro is referred to as the Oyabun in this chapter. He also
sports a pompadour, which is the iconic yakuza hairstyle in Japan.

Courtesans (Oiran): Oiran is a type of Yuujo (I # woman of
pleasure/ prostitute) that became prominent in the Early Edo Period.
However, different from normal Yuujo who simply sleep with clients, they
are trained in various traditional arts so that they can entertain clients.
NOTE: They are not to be confused with Geishas. Geishas are pure
performers/entertainers and do not sleep with their clients.
𢅛
A Procession of Courtesans
Status and Rank of Oirans (1760s): Kamuro_» Shinzo/Hikifune-› Unranked
+ Hashi -› Tsubone - › Koshi - › Tayú/Dayú
Note that this is only a rough guideline. Ranks and titles changed frequently
with time. Tayú is the highest rank for an Oiran. It was extremely expensive
to obtain the services of a Tayu and they were prestigious enough to decline
even the wealthiest of clients.
On the other side of the spectrum, Kamuro are young girls (brought in at
5-10 years old) that attend to the needs of high-ranking oiran. In return,
the high-rainking oiran would teach them about the ins and out of being an
oiran. The young girls will then eventually grow to become oirans themselves
when they are of age.GO AHEAD

ADDING "O."
IN FRONT
OF IT!
ITS
TOKO.
HEY,
WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?
HAHAHA!!

AHAHA
HAHA!!

BUHAH-!!
PM NOT A
BOY, THOUGH!!
AHAHAHA!!
O-TOKO.
CHAN.
BUT I AM
O-TOKO!
T/N: COURTESANS (OIAN) ARE WOMEN OF PLEASURE (IE. PROSTITUTES).
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH GEISHA WHO ARE SOLELY PERFORMERS
TN: "OTOKO* IN JAPANESE MEANS "MALE/MAN". THE JOKE IS THAT SHE'S A GIRL, SINCE
"O-' IS AN HONORIFIC ADDED IN FRONT OF THE NAMES OF FEMALES (O-ROBI, O-VAM).
AH! THATS RIGHT! PLL
