AHHH, THE FERRIS
WHEEL.
... IT'S MY
DREAM TO HAVE A GO
ON THAT SOMEDAY.
HACHI! WHAT
EXACTLY ARE WE
DOING HERE AT THESE
ISLANDS, ANYWAY? YOU
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
•COATING" OR
SOMETHING, RIGHT..
BASICALLY, IF YOU DO
THAT, THE SHIP WILL
BE ABLE TO TRAVEL
UNDER THE WATER!
HUH?!
REALLY?!
THAT'LL BE
SHABONDY
PARK.
THEME
PARK!
HEY, GuYS,
I CAN SEE
A
THEME PARK!!
LET'S GO!! I
WANNA GO ON
THE FERRIS
WHEEL!I
I WANT TO GO
ON IT, TOO...
BUT MAYBE I
CAN'T......
..YE-AH, I
KNOW...
STOP THAT
NONSENSE!!
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T DO
THAT, CAIME!!
PREAM..
WHY CAN'T YOU
GO ON IT?
NYul--!!WE HAVE
TO GO AND FIND
OURSELVES A
COATING MECHANIC.
...AND HAVE HIM
COAT YOUR SHIP
IN THIS RESIN!
ONE PIECE
第49台龍
ânetAND THE TREES
ARE REALLY HUGE,
TO0??! AND LOOK
AT THOSE STRIPES!!
IT LOOKS LIKE
CANDY!!!
PAPPAGG: WELL,
THEN, LET'S DROP
ANCHOR HERE, AT
GROVE 41.
=
MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T
FORGET THE
NUMBER,
EVERYONE!!
THE ISLANDS ARE ALL
LINKED TOGETHER BY
BRIDGES, SO AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T FORGET
YOUR NUMBER, YOU
WON'T GET LOST.

STOP
LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT!.
rEAN.
I CAN THINK
OF ONE GUY
WHOD GET
LOST ANYWAY.
E'*
PaARE THOSE
SOAP-BUBBLES
COMING FROM
THE ISLAND?!
THEY'RE JUST
FLOATING ON
ENDLESSLY
UPWARDS,
ONE AFTER
ANOTHER...!
WHAT'S
uP WITH
THOSE?!
WHO'S
BLOWING
THEM ALL?!
I'M SORRY -
COULD I INTER-
RUPT FOR JUST
A MOMENT?
HOW?
THE SHABONDY
ARCHIPELAGO IS
REALLY JUST A HUGE
GROWTH OF TREES; IT
DOESN'T HAVE ANY
MAGNETIC PULL!
NYU!! YOU
DON'T NEED
TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT!
...BUT WON'T
IT CHANGE ITS
COURSE IF WE
STOP HERE AT
THIS ISLAND?!
THAT THING'S
NOT EVEN AN
ISLAND?!
THAT'S NOT
REALLY AN
EXPLANATION
OH...
OF COURSE!
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S POINTING
THE WAY TO
FISHMAN
ISLAND.
YES, THEY
COME FROM
THE ISLAND.
WILL THE
LOG POSE BE
ALL RIGHT?
mangareader.netBUT FOR OUTLAWS
LIKE YOURSELVES
ONLY ONE OF THEM'S
REALLY OPEN TO
You!!
FIRST UP!!
THEREARE ACTUALLY
TWO WAYS TO GET
THROUGH TO THE NEW
WORLD FROM HERE!!
SO IT'S TIME
FOR SOMEBODY TO
EXPLAIN THE INS AND
OUTS OF THIS AREA TO
ALL OF YOU! AND WHO
COULD THAT SOME-
BODY BE...
ALL RIGHT,
PAY ATTENTION,
EVERYONE!
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE REALLY IN
THE DARKABOLIT
ALL THIS...
WHY
ME, OF
COURSE!!!
WHYZAT?
BUT FOR PIRATES
LIKE YOURSELVES,
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD EVER
GET PERMISSION!!
YOU CAN CROSS THE
RED LINE BY GOING OVER
THE TOP, THROUGH THE
HOLY LAND, MARIEJOA,
WHICH LIES AT THE
VERY SUMMIT!
WHY, YOU ASK?!!
WHY, BECAUSE THE
FIRST WAY IS TO
REQUEST PASSAGE
FROM THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT!
A An
IT COSTS A FAIR BIT
OF CASH. OF COURSE,
AND THE APPLICATION
TAKES TIME, BUT IT'S THE
SAFEST ROUTE, SO IT'S
WHAT MOST PEOPLE
OPT FOR.
LEAVE
THE SHIP
BEHIND
~~-?!!
WELL, YOU'D HAVE
TO LEAVE YOUR SHIP
BEHIND, AND JUST GET
YOURSELF A NICE NEW
ONE ON THE OTHER
SIDE
WAIT, YOu
MEAN WALKING
OVER THE RED LINE
ITSELF? BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE SHIP?

CALMIE, CAIMIE?
I DON'T REMEM-
BER HANDING
OVER TO YOU...!
BUT THE
"OCEAN-FLOOR
ROUTE" ISN'T
THE SAFEST OF
JOURNEYS TO

IT'S THE
"OCEAN-FLOOR

GOES STRAIGHT
BY FISHMAN
ISLAND!!!
HOWEVER!!
ON THE ROUTE
YOU'LL BE TAKING,
YOUR SHIP COMES
WITH YOu!
PLENTY OF PEOPLE
WHO TRIED TO TAKE THIS
ROUTE ENDED UP GETTING
EATEN BY SEA-MONSTERS
OR SEA KINGS, SHIP

HuH!?
BUT WHAT
KIND OF SHIP CAN
TRAVEL ON THE
OCEAN FLOOR?!
BUT WAIT A MINUTE,
CALMIE. YOU SAID.
"SHIP AND ALL", RIGHT?

EITHER.
AHHH...
I
DON'T THINK I

OH, BUT OF COURSE,
FROM OUR PERSPEC-
TIVE, IT'S A REALLY
BIG HOLE!!
NO, NO, THAT'S
FINE! YOU SEE, IN
THAT HUGE WALL THAT
GOES AROUND THE
WHOLE WORLD...
BUT THIS
SHIP DOESN'T
HAVE THE
ABILITY TO
DIVE.
THIS SHIP.
OF COURSE!
...IN THE RED
LINE, THERE'S
JUST ONE TINY
LITTLE HOLE IN A
CERTAIN PLACE
AND THAT'S
WHERE FISHMAN
ISLAND IS!!!
er.netHOW
DOES THAT
WORK.
„OH.
DEAR, IT'S
ALL STICKY.
THAT!!
THAT'S
SO COOL!
LUFFY.
