YOU'LL SEE FLAGS LIKE
THAT ONE AT THE ENTRANCE
TO THE ISLAND, AND IN THE
PORT, AS WELL. IT'S THAT
FLAG THAT'S PROTECTING
OUR ISLAND RIGHT NOW!!
BETTER KNOWN
AS BIG MAM
ONE OF THE
YONKOU!
THE FLAG BELONGS
TO A PIRATE FROM THE
NEW WORLD, NAME OF
CHARLOTTE RINRIN!!
IN RETURN, SHE
EXPECTS A HUGE
DELIVERY OF DELICIOUS
SWEETS FROM US EACH
MONTH. THAT'S WHAT
THE FACTORY'S FOR
BEFORE THE
WAR, WE HAD
WHITEBEARD'S
NAME,
SWEETS?!
WITHOUT A POWERFUL
NAME LIKE THAT TO PROTECT
US, OUR COUNTRY WOULD
COLLAPSE. THAT'S JUST HOW
SERIOUS THE PIRATE PROBLEM
IS AROUND THESE PARTS.
-AND THAT KEPT
US SAFE FROM THE
HANDS OF OTHER
PIRATES. THESE DAYS,
BIG MAM DOES THE
SAME JOB.
BIG MAM, HUH.
A YONKOL, JUST
LIKE SHANKS..
YOU COULD SAY
THAT. THOUGH OF
COURSE, WHITEBEARD
NEVER ASKED FOR
ANYTHING IN RETURN.
STILL, IF SHE'S
PROTECTING YOU JUST
LIKE WHITEBEARD, THIS BIG
MAM MUST BE A PRETTY ALL
RIGHT SORT OF WOMAN.
T'D LOVE
TO MEET HER
SOMEDAY..
TO BIG MAM,
I SUPPOSE IT'S
LIKE A BUSINESS
OF SORTS.CHAPTER 610 "FORTUNE-TELLER MADAM SHIRLEY"

REQUEST: "SUPERVISED BY SIAMESE CATS, VIVI CLEANS THE ROYAL BATHROOMS* (REAL NAME HATTORI JEAN- BAPTISTE AKIRA)
5u, mangareader.netD: Nice to meet you Odacchi sensei! I will also want to go to Kuraigana
Island to meet Mihawk, but should the souvenir be takoyaki after all?!
Ah, FYI, I'll be coming from Osaka. P.N. Appi-I
O: Please also bring fried squid for him. It's my favorite food
Ah, you didn't ask.
D: In Volume 45 when Garp punched Luffy, why did it work? Was it
Haki after all? Or was it "Love"? P.N. Mori-san
O: It is Love" in this case.
D: I have fallen in love with Akainu's ability. Is that the Gutsu Gutsu
no Mi? (Boil Boil Fruit) Or, is it the Magu Magu no Mi? (Lava Lava
Fruit) There are too many candidate names that I can't figure out
which it is. Please tell me!! P.N. Isshi- 414
O: So I haven't officially write this anywhere? There were
questions on the Three Admirals' abilities here and there that came. It is as
shown below.

D: This is a question. Is the scar on Luffy's chest from 2 years ago
when Akainu attacked Jibe and Luffy? I remembered when I
watched the anime yesterday... P.N. Princess Shirasuboshi
O: Yes indeed. That bastard penetrated Jinbe's arm and
left a large scar on Luffy's chest! That bastard!!Yes. And
so, this time's SBS ends here. Adding to that, Brook's
sei jù, Cho-san's BS that was scheduled for this volume will have to be postponed
to the next volume due to a little bit of a hassle here and there. Meaning, since we
stretched the date for all the question collecting to end, you can still make it! Since
it will be the last seiyu SBS, make no regrets!! In the next volume-~

NEPTUNE, GOT REALLY
ANGRY, AND SENT THE
THREE PRINCES WE

EVENTUALLY, HE
STARTED SCALING IT

TO PACKAGES, AND
FINALLY TO MARRIAGE
PROPOSALS - COMPLETE
WITH BLACKMAIL...!!
YEAH, THAT DECKEN.
TO BEGIN WITH, HE
SENT A LOVE LETTER
TO THE PRINCESS OF
OUR KINGDOM EVERY
SINGLE WEEK.
THEY'VE SEARCHED
FAR AND WIDE, WITH
THE HELP OF THE
ROYAL ARMY, BUT
THEY STILL HAVEN'T
MANAGED TO FIND
HIM!!
WHAT I'M MORE
INTERESTED IN HEARING
IS WHETHER THIS VANDER
DECKEN REALLY IS A
CURSED PIRATE FROM
HUNDREDS OF YEARS
AGO!!!
AND THEN HE HAS FOUR
CHILDREN. THE YOUNGEST
IS THE MERMAID PRINCESS.
AND HER ELDER BROTHERS
ARE THE THREE PRINCES
