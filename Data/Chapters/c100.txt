LET'S THINK ABOUT EVOLUTION
TODAY, SHALL WE? OR NOT.
OR LET'S. HUMANS HAVE
EVOLVED FROM APES, JUST
LIKE IN THE PICTURE ABOVE.
IN CASE YOU COULDN'T TELL,
OUR BACKS ARE ARCHED BY
JUST A LITTLE. NOW THEN, THE
QUESTION IS WHAT FORM WILL
HUMANS OF THE FUTURE TAKE.
I FOR ONE, BELIEVE THAT WE
ARE HEADING TOWARDS A
BACKFLIP, THUS, THE HUMANS
OF THE FUTURE SHOULD BE
FLOATING UP IN THE AIR.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN.
@古地商高路的那用会qler.netBUT KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T
PICK UP THIS
SWORD FOR
FUN!
YOU DARE GO
EASY ON ME IN
A SERIOUS DUEL
JUST BECALISE
OF THE FACT THAT

POWERFUL
AS MEN!?

EXPECT SOMEONE
LIKE YOU TO EVER
UNDERSTAND
