ARE YOU GONE, ElICHIRO ODA...? NOW I CAN FINALLY START THE SBS
WITH MY HEART AT EASE..
• SO.
SBS, START!!
O (ODA):
... THAT WAS SO LONG AGO, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT. WHEN YOU SAY JUMP
FESTA, YOU MEAN THE EVENT THAT JUMP HOLDS EVERY YEAR AT THE END OF
THE YEAR, RIGHT? IT'S A BIG ANNUAL EVENT, SO IT'S INTERESTING. IN THE TWO
DAYS, OVER 100,000 PEOPLE CAME. THIS TIME THERE WAS A ONE PIECE
MUSICAL, TOO. AMAZING.
WELL THEN, LET'S START THE SBS.
HELLO, ODA-SENSEI! I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED,
ARE ALL THE MARINE CAPTAINS [TAISA] AND
ABOVE AT
THE
MARINE
HEADQUARTERS
DIFFERENT THAN THE CAPTAINS AT THE MARINE
BASES? ARE THEY JUST RAISED TOUGHER,
OR WHAT?
BY THE GUY FROM THE MASK STORE
O: YES. THEY'RE WAY DIFFERENT. THE MARINE
HEADQUARTERS ARE LIKE THE SUPER-ELITE
OF THE MARINES. THESE MEN WHO APPEARED
AT THE ASSEMBLY IN VOLUME 11. THESE ARE
THE MEN IN THE HEADQUARTERS' "LIEUTENANT"
RANKS (CAPTAIN [TAI], FIRST LT., SECOND LT.) BUT IF THE FORMER BASE CAPTAIN
[TAISA] "AXE-ARM MORGAN" OR "CAPTAIN [TAISA] NEZUMI" FROM NAMI'S HOME WERE
THERE, THEY WOULD BE AMONG THOSE MEN. THE HEADQUARTERS AND STANDARD
BASE RANKS ARE ABOUT THREE RANKS APART, YOU COULD SAY. A HIGHER CAPTAIN
