QUESTIONS
ANSWERS
D: PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR PROFILE! (IS ELICHIRO ODA YOUR
REAL NAME?)
O: YES, "EIICHIRO ODA" IS MY REAL NAME. I WAS BORN IN
(JAPANESE YEAR NAME) YEAR 50/ MONTH I/DAY I
(JANUARY I, 1975). BLOOD TYPE A, CAPRICORN. I WAS BORN
IN THE YEAR OF RABBIT. I LOVE MOVIES. I'LL WORK HARD!
D: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ODA-SENSEI. WHEN DID SENSEI
DECIDE TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST? ALSO, WHAT
STEPS DID YOU TAKE TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST? CAN
YOU PLEASE TELL ME?
O: FIRST, I WANTED TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST WHEN I
WAS AROUND 4. WHEN I LEARNED "MANGA ARTIST" IS A
PROFESSION, I WAS THINKING, "WHEN I GROW UP. I'LL BE A
MANGA ARTIST, THERE'S NO WORK TO BE DONE. IT'S
GREAT?". THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED. I THINK I STARTED TO
DRAW MANGA WHEN I WAS IN MY 2ND YEAR OF UR. HIGH
SCHOOL. WHAT DID I DO TO PRACTICE? JUST DOODLING!
EVEN NOW, I HAVE A HABIT OF DOODLING ON MY NOTE-
BOOK, WHILE THINKING ABOUT THE STORY LINE.
D: THIS IS A KINDA OUT OF THE TRACK QUESTION. IN "MIZU
NO TOMODACHI KAPPAMAN" (BY TOKUHIRO MASAYA)
VOLUME I, PAGE 93 FRAME 4, YOUR NAME "ElICHIRO ODA"
WAS WRITTEN IN IT, WHY IS THAT? HAVE YOU BEEN A
MANGA ARTIST'S ASSISTANT?
O: IT'S BEEN SO LONG. YOU'RE QUITE SHARP TO FIND IT!
I WAS A MANGA ARTIST'S ASSISTANT. MY EXPERIENCES
ARE: KAITANI SHINOBU-SENSEI'S "MIDORIYAMA POLICE
GANG", TOKUHIRO MASAYA-SENSE'S "MIZU NO TOMO
DACHI KAPPAMAN" AND "JUNGLE NO OUJA TAA-CHAN"
AND WATSUKI NOBUHIRO-SENSEI'S "RUROUNI KENSHIN".
D: HOW MANY "DEVIL'S FRUIT" ARE THERE? AND, WHAT KIND
OF FRUIT ARE THEY?
O: IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, PLEASE JUST
CONTINUE READING MY MANGA. HOW MANY ARE THERE?
FROM THE RUMORS I'VE HEARD, THERE ARE OVER I00. AND
MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE AT "THAT
PLACE"
