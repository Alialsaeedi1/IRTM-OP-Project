YOU!?BUT TO LABOON,
THOSE PIRATES
WERE HIS POD
MEMBERS.
NORMALLY,
ISLAND WHALES
ARE KNOWN TO SWIM
TOGETHER IN PODS,
BUT FEARING THAT
GRAND LINE WAS
TOO DANGEROUS,
THEY LEFT HIM
BEHIND OR SO
THEY THOUGHT
IT SEEMS THAT
LABOON HAD
ACCOMPANIED
THEIR JOURNEY
IN WEST BLUE,
AND SO, ON THE
DAY OF THEIR
DEPARTURE, THEIR
CAPTAIN ASKED ME,
THEIR SHIP
WAS DAMAGED WHEN
THEY ARRIVED SO
THEY STAYED HERE
FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS TO FIX IT.
"COULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF LABOON FOR
2-3 YEARS?"
I BECAME QUITE
GOOD FRIENDS
WITH THEM DURING
THEIR STAY.
BUOO
UNDER-
STANDING
THEIR INTENT,
LABOON
PATIENTLY
WAITED FOR
THEM HERE.

D: HERE'S A QUESTION. WHEN DO FANLETTERS REACH YOU,
ODA-SENSEI? EVERY WEEK? FOR INSTANCE, IF I MAILED ONE ON
NOVEMBER 1ST, WHEN DOES IT FALL INTO YOUR HANDS? PLEASE
LET ME KNOW.
O: FIRST OF ALL, THE LETTERS EVERYONE SENDS ME ARE DELIVERED TO
THE WEEKLY SHONEN JUMP EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT. THERE, PEOPLE
WORKING PART-TIME SEPARATE THE LETTERS ACCORDING TO
AUTHOR, AND MY MANAGER SENDS ME MY LETTERS ONCE A WEEK.
SO IF YOU'RE LUCKY, IT MIGHT EVEN BE THE DAY IT ARRIVES AT THE
EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT. IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS WITHIN A WEEK OR
TWO, THOUGH.
D: YOU SAID IN VOLUME 7 THAT WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING
CHARACTERS' FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, YOU MAKE THE SAME FACE.
DO YOU DO THE SAME THING WHEN YOU DRAW ONE OF NAMI'S
SEXY FACES? DO YOU MAKE AN "OOH-LA-LA" FACE?
O:
OF COURSE. I'M FAMOUS WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC FOR MY SEXY
FACES. THEY THINK I MIGHT BE HOTTER THAN A MAGAZINE MODEL
QUEEN.
D: YO! SO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE TALKED, EI-CHAN.CEHEHE!)
I'M SO EMBARRASED! ANYWAY, I HAVE A QUESTION. BUGGY THE
CLOWN CAN SPLIT HIMSELF IN PIECES, RIGHT? WHICH MEANS HE
CAN ALSO DO IT DOWN THERE, IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT..
... I CAN'T
GET ANY MORE SPECIFIC! DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT! DON'T DRAW
ANYTHING UNTIL YOU ANSWER THIS QUESTION!!
O: HIS PENIS CAN FLY TOO.
mangareader.netI DON'T HAVE
MUCH SEDATIVES
LEFT. LOOKS LIKE I
NEED TO GO MAKE
SOME MORE.
