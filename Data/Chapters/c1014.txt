¡COVER REQUEST BY TAKASHI:
"LAW GATHERING HIS WITS IN FRONT:
OF A BYOBU FOLDING SCREEN *
DEPICTING A TIGER"
T/N: COVER INSPIRED BY A JAPANESE
FOLKTALE ABOUT IKKYU-SAN, A YOUNG
BUDDHIST MONK, WHO IS TASKED WITH USING
HIS WITS TO CAPTURE A BYOBU TIGER.CHAPTER NOTES:
The reference from the Cover Page with Law is based on
a famous story about Ikkyu-san, a Zen Buddhist monk
in the 14-15th century. His mischievous childhood exploits,
outwitting adults during his stay at Anokoku-ji temple,
have been retold countless times in folklore.
Toei animation produced a hit Anime series based on
these legends between 1975 and 1982.
This show popularized the image of Ikkyu-san planing
while in lotus position with his index fingers on his head
HUN
TER
One of the most famous tales involves a Lord
trying to test the boy by claiming he needed help taming a
tiger that would sneak out of a byob folding screen.
This lie fails as Ikkyu-san is able to make the lord admit
it is impossible for the tiger to get out of the painting.
Law was probably chosen for this request because he is
known for his planning and his nickname 15
"tora"
is Japanese for tiger.
