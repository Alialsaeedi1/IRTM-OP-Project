此nga集劳女IDIOT... OF COURSE IT'S GONNA
BE COLD AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE OCEAN! IT'S LIKE A BATH
THE WATER AT THE BOTTOM'S
ALWAYS COOLER THAN THE
WATER AT THE TOP!
WE'RE GOING
SOMEWHERE
COLD? I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING
TO THE SEA
BOTTOM.
YOU SHOULD ALL
PUT ON COATS LIKE
THIS, BY THE WAY. IT'S
GOING TO GET COLD
FROM HERE ON OUT.
THERE IS
JUST ONE
OH, RIGHT!
SO THE BOTTOM
OF THE OCEAN
WOULD BE
COLDER THAN
IT IS AT THE
SURFACE!!
HUH?! THERE
ARE CURRENTS
UNDERNEATH
CURRENTS??
YOU SURE KNOW
AN AWFUL LOT!
THESE CURRENTS
MOVE IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
TO THE "SURFACE
CURRENTS" THAT WE
ARE CURRENTLY
EXPERIENCING.
...THERE ARE
ALSO WHAT IS CALLED
"DEEPWATER CURRENTS";
ENTIRE CURRENTS OF
WATER THAT ONE WOLLD
NEVER BE AWARE OF
FROM THE SURFACE
IT IS NOT ONLY
THE TEMPERATURE
THAT IS DIFFERENT!
IN THE DEPTHS
OF THE OCEAN..
SURFACE
CURRENTS
YOU ARE
HERE
YOHOHO!
I AM YOUR
ELDER, AFTER
ALL

THESE
INTERCONNECTED
CURRENTS FLOW
UNBROKEN THROUGH
THE SEAS OF THE
ENTIRE WORLD!
SURFACE
CURRENTS
t't.
WHAT'S MORE, THESE
CURRENTS ARE ALWAYS
INTERCONNECTED SOMEHOW!
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN
SPLITTING OFF TO THE EAST
AND WEST OR COMING BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.
活
THERE ARE CURRENTS
RISING UP TO HIGHER
LEVELS, OR DRILLING
DEEPER DOWN... ALL
CONNECTED TOGETHER
LIKE SOME KIND OF
GIANT DRAGON!
meNanareader.netINDEED... FOR
THIS REASON, MANY
LEGENDS SURROUND
THE DARK, UNEXPLORED
REGIONS TRAVELLED BY
THESE DEEPWATER
CURRENTS...
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS?!
...THAT ONCE A SHIP
HAS TRAVELLED DOWN
TO THE DEEPEST DEPTHS,
IT CAN TAKE AS MUCH
AS TWO THOUSAND YEARS
BEFORE THEY EVER REACH
THE SURFACE AGAIN!
MIGHTY
BEASTS...
!!
CURSES...!!
THE SOULS OF
THE DEAD...
THAT WAY,
WE'LL BE TAKEN
STRAIGHT DOWN TO
THE DEEPWATER
CURRENTS AND WE
CAN REACH THE
SEA BED!!
WELL, WHO KNOWS? THE
IMPORTANT THING IS, WE'RE
GETTING ON ONE OF THOSE
CURRENTS THAT RUNS FROM
THE SURFACE CURRENTS TO
THE DEEPWATER LEVELS!
NOW I'M
GETTING
EXCITED!!
OH! YOU'RE
RIGHT!! MAN,
YOU'RE REALLY
SMART..
I GET IT!!
SO THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HEADING
INTO COLDER
WATERS!!!
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT WE
WERE SAYING ABOUT THE
BATHWATER... WHERE THE WATER
GETS COLDER, THE CURRENTS
START TO FLOW DOWNWARD.
or
FROM WHAT I HAVE
HEARD, THE DEEPWATER
CURRENTS FLOW ALONG
THE SEA BED AT A RATHER
LEISURELY PACE... SO
SLOWLY, IN FACT.
TH-
THERE ARE?!
THAT'S 50
SCARY!!!
WHAAAAA?!!
THERE ARE
GHOSTS AT
THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA
?!!
BUT WAIT... HOW DO
WE EVEN FIND THESE...
PLACES WHERE THE
WATER FLOWS DOWN??IT'S
ONE THING
TO HEAR
ABOUT IT.
BUT SEEING
IT FIRST-HAND
IS ANOTHER

D: Hello Oda-sensei. Are you well? You always end up letting the readers say the
phrase "SBS Start", and I am also one of those people that want to say "SBS
Start" and start the process. But you know, the phrase "SBS Start" is after all
a phrase that Oda-sensei should say since it is "SBS Sta.-...P.N. Nyonsuke
O: ST000000P !! (shock) YOU SAID IT TOO MANY TIMES-!!! Ugh. It started.
About 4 times.
D: Hello- Hello-! Odacchi! Out of the blue, but my friend came
saying "I can activate the Buster Call with my nipple" some
time ago. Plus, apparently she can call a Fleet Admiral with
it. And so, here's a question to Odacchi. Can Odacchi activate
the Buster Call with his nipple? P.N. Matsuko Deluxe
O: IS YOUR BRAIN OKAY ---!!? Sigh... Ah, I am sorry.. I became so violent at my
precious reader... I will properly respond. Uhhh... with my nipple, I can summon
5 warships and... OF COURSE NOT!!! YOU MORON!!. ..gasp... sorry, natural reaction.
D: I have found a strange confusion, Miss!! (This reader is pretending
Oda is a female next-door neighbor) In Volume 51, around when
Sabaody Island is first introduced, the Luffy that grew obese after
eating takoyaki suddenly became skinny, and then on the next page
he is fat again!! How is this possible!! Is it because he is rubber?! I'm
so curious I can't go back to my home in outer space. Pwease tell
me
