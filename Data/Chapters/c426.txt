the Shichibukai?
R: Odacchi, nice to meet you!! I Pinally sent in a postcard. I have a serious
question, so answer it properly. It's about the attack
Sanji used to take down Jyabura. If Jyabura felt that
it was that hot, then the temperature Must have been
really high, right!!7 Why doesn't Sanji feel like it's hot?
Answer Me!
-Oda Gelichirou
O: What are you saying...? What are you saying!!? Do your
eyes even work!!7 What were you looking at during that
fight!!7 His leg is hot!? It's not hot at all!! Sanji's heart
was burning much hotter than that.!!
R: How is your health this summer#7
-Naoko
O: R... Right. I'm doing well, how about you?
"This is a traditional midsummer greeting thing to ask about someone's health.
Kind of like a Christmas card. But, the line is traditionally "Shochuumimai mo ageMasu,
not "Moushiwake gozainasen, " like she writes. That's why Oda corrects her.
