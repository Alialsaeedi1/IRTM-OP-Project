Luff's Favorite Seat
@ It's the bow, so to speak.
@ Luffy seems to like this spot.
He sits right on top.
Nami's Orange Fields
@ These are three orange trees taken from
Bellemere-san's plantation when they left
Cocoyashi Village.
@Nami is the one who takes care of them.
G
(© However, it seems to be Sanji's job to protect
the oranges from enemies (i.e. Lufy).
It's a mystery as to why he likes to sit there so
much, when he can't even swit. But hey, he really
seems to like it, so what's the big deal?
(@ They are extremely delicious.
