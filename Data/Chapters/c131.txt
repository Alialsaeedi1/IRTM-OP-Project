D:
WOULD YOU LIKE AN ELEPHANT NOSE RADISH? (I CAUGHT ONE
MYSELF!) BY CHOJIN CANADIAN-MAN
O: MMM, LOOKS GOOD. THANK YOU. CHOMP CHOMP GOBBLE GOBBLE...
URG! URG... UHAAGH!!
...CHOMP CHOMP GOBBLE GOBBLE.
D: HOW ARE YOU, ODA-CHAN? ANYWAYS, IN MIDDLE SCHOOL I WAS
GIVEN A FORM FOR PLANNING MY FUTURE COURSE IN LIFE, BUT
WHEN I ASKED THE TEACHER, "CAN I WRITE 'PIRATE' AS MY
NUMBER TWO WISH?" HE SAID,
"BE SERIOUS." I AM SERIOUS!
BY SAORI
O:
OF COURSE YOU ARE. HOW CAN ANYONE WRITE THAT WITH OUT
PUTTING THEIR HEART INTO IT? TELL YOUR TEACHER THIS, FROM ME!!
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING A PILLAGER?!"
D: WHEN I WATCHED THE ONE PIECE ANIME, AT THE PART THAT
CORRESPONDS TO VOLUME 7, CHAPTER 57 (BECAUSE OF DREAMS),
IT SAYS THE REASON ZEFF LOST HIS LEG WAS BECAUSE IT GOT
TORN OFF IN THE SHIPWRECK. WAS THAT CHANGED BECAUSE OF
THE YOUNG CHILDREN WATCHING THE SHOW?
O: YES. THE CONCEPT OF EATING YOUR OWN LEG IN THAT PART OF THE
STORY WOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A SHOCK FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT A MEDIUM SUCH AS TELEVISION HAS TENS
OF MILLIONS OF VIEWERS, IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO FAIL
TO ADAPT TO GUIDELINES. IT'S AMAZING THAT ALL THOSE ANIMATORS
CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE SUCH WONDERFUL SHOWS WHILE STILL
HAVING TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES ALL THE TIME! IF YOU CAN FEEL
THEIR LOVE WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW, PLEASE SEND FAN
LETTERS TO TOE ANIMATION. IT'LL CHEER EVERYONE UP THERE.
