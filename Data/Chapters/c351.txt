I
THOUGHT
IT WAS A
DREAM AT
FIRST.
WHEN I'D HEARD
THE RESULTS OF
THE EVALLIATION..
I DECIDED THAT IT
WASN'T JUST MY
IMAGINATION
BACK THEN.
I NEVER
FOUND OUT WHO,
BUT THE NEXT
DAY, THE SHIP
WAS REPAIRED IN
A VERY POOR
FASHION.
THE FOG
WAS REALLY
THICK, BUT
SOMEONE WAS
DEFINATELY
THERE.
FROM
THE
EMPTY
SHIP
...!!
ONE
NIGHT.
T
HEARD THE
SOUNDS OF
HAMMERING
-I DON'T
CARE IF
YOu DON'T
BELIEVE
ME...

PROBABLY
THINK I'M
CRAZY.
AND
WANTED TO
WARN US

HE?

A FAIRY THAT
DWELLS ON
SHIPS THAT ARE
WELL CARED FOR..

INCARNATION
OF THE SHIP.
