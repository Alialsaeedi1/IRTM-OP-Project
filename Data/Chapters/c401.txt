ALL RIGHT, I COULD READ IT!! WAIT A SECOND,

R: IS CAPTAIN KURO'S "SHAKUSHI" FASTER THAN CP9'S
"SORU"? TELL ME.
-MEAT KING
O: OKAY. THIS QUESTION CAME LIP MORE OFTEN THAN I
EXPECTED. CAPTAIN KURO'S "SHAKUSHI" APPEARED IN
VOLLIME 5) WAS A PRETTY STRONG TECHNIQUE. I
WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF SPEED, THEY'RE ABOLIT
EQUAL. HOWEVER, WHEN CAPTAIN KURO USES HIS
TECHNIQUE, HE MOVES SO FAST THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHO HE'S ATTACKING, WHILE THE CP9 MEMBERS
CAN CONTROL THEMSELVES AT THAT SPEED. SO BASI-
CALLY, IF THEY FOLGHT, CP9 WOULD HAVE AN OVER-
WHELMING VICTORY.
R: HI, ODA!! IN VOLUME 36, YOU WROTE "WHEN YOU'RE
TAKING A TEST, IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER,
JUST WRITE 'INSTRUMENTAL,' SO I REALLY TRIED
IT. BUT WHEN I GOT THE TEST BACK, I GOT A
CHECK MARK. WHY DID I GET IT WRONG? PLEASE
TELL ME, ODA.
-KATSUFUMI FOUR!!
O: THE RESULT DOESN'T MATTER. THE REAL TREASURE IS
THE COURAGE YOU GAINED BY TAKING THAT STEP
FORWARD.
