mangareader.net質問
D:
DID YOU KNOW THAT COBY'S FATHER IS THE WORLD CHAMPION OF
JUMP-ROPE?
O: NO... I DID NOT KNOW THAT. COBY'S DAD SURE IS AMAZING.
D: IS IT TRUE THAT CLAHADOR'S PET IS A MAMMOTH?
O: NO... I DID NOT KNOW THAT EITHER. I SUPPOSED HE WAS KEEPING
IT AROUND THAT MANSION..
?
D:
WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU USE TO PICK YOUR USOPP GALLERY
PIRATES?
O:
WELL, THE DRAWING SKILL, HOW FUN IT IS, THE ARTISTIC SENSE...
BUT OF COURSE, THE MOST VALUABLE THING FOR ANY POSTCARD
IS SPIRIT.
D: WHEN I WAS WORKING AT A FRUIT STAND A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
THERE WAS SOME LITTLE BRAT WHO SAID, "HOW DUMB, THIS PLACE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY GOMU GOMU FRUITS."
IF A KID LIKE THAT
COMES TO THE SHOP AGAIN, WHAT SHOULD I SAY? PLEASE TELL
ME. (SERIOUSLY)
O: IN THOSE SITUATIONS, THIS IS WHAT ALL THESE CHARACTERS
WOULD DO.
MAKINO-SAN:
"YES, I'M SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY." SHRUG IT
OFF LIKE AN ADULT.
SHANKS:
"DAHAHAHAHA!! YOU'RE 10 YEARS TOO YOUNG FOR
A DEVIL FRUIT!!" TEASE THEM.
LUFFY:
"I'LL BLOW YOU AWAY RIGHT NOW." SHOW NO
MERCY. MIMIC THE CHARACTER YOU FEEL MOST
SIMILAR TO.
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS.
D: TAKE A CHARACTER FAN POLL!!
O: UHHH, I WON'T DO IT IN THE BOOKS, BUT I ALREADY DID ONE IN
JUMP, AND THE RESULTS WILL APPEAR ON P.148. (THIS POLL WAS
RUN FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTER CHAPTER 49,
"THE
STORM.")
