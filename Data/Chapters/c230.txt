THAT PIGEONS
ALSO HAVE
THIS ABILITY
IT IS SAID THAT
SOME ANIMALS
CONTAIN SOME
BIO-COMPASS
ENHANCING THEIR
DIRECTION SENSE
YOU WON'T BE
ABLE TO EVEN
TRY GETTING
ONTO SKY

IN OTHER
WORDS, YOU
CAN'T DO
ANYTHING
WITHOUT A
BIRD LIKE
THAT!!!
NO MATTER HOW
FAR AWAY YOU
MOVE THE BIRD,
IT'LL ALWAYS
POINT TO THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.
AMONG
THOSE

SENSE OF
DIRECTION.
