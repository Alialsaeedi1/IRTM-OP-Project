mangareader.net賈問
D: Ol!! ODA-KUN!! SIT DOWN RIGHT THERE!! NOW LISTEN UP!! I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ANY JUNK ABOUT YOU WANTING TO LOOK AT THE
SIDE OF YOUR FACE!! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU BREAK
YOUR NECK?! VALUE YOUR LIFE, SONNY!! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
BE SCOLDED BY SOME YOUNGER GUY LIKE MYSELF!! THINK ON
THIS!! YOU MAY GO!!
O: SIGH... I'M VERY SORRY.
D:
WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK AT THE SIDE OF MY FACE IN A MIRROR LIKE
YOU SAID ON THE INSIDE COVER OF VOLUME 7, I TWISTED MY NECK
AND HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. THE DOCTOR ASKED ME, "HOW
DID THIS HAPPEN TO YOU?" WHAT SHOULD I HAVE TOLD HIM?
O: HEY... A KINDRED SPIRIT.
D: HELLO. I HAVE WINE IN MY HOUSE, SO I WONDERED, "WHAT
COUNTRY IS IT FROM?" AND WHEN I LOOKED ON THE BACK, I SAW
THE WORDS "DRY, FULL BODY." IT WAS A BIT OF SURPRISE. BUT
WAS RATHER PLEASED. IS THIS THE ORIGIN OF FULLBODY-SAN'S
(THE IRONFIST) NAME? IT IS, ISN'T IT? IF IT ISN'T, I THINK MY
LIFE MIGHT BE OVER.
O: IT'S NOT OVER! YOU ARE RIGHT! I REALLY DON'T DRINK MUCH WINE,
SO I DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT, BUT I LEARNED THAT THE
STRENGTH AND HEAVINESS OF THE TASTE IS WHAT YOU CALL ITS
"BODY"! HEAVY WINE WITH A LONG FERMENTATION TIME HAS A "FULL
BODY," AND AS IT GETS LIGHTER IT GOES TO "MEDIUM BODY," AND
THEN "LIGHT BODY"! THUS MY EXPLANATION OF LIEUTENANT
FULLBODY'S NAME IS COMPLETE! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!
D:
WHERE DID DANDY GIN-SAN HIDE THOSE WEAPONS OF HIS? HUH?
THERE?! WELL GREAT, THIS THOUGHT IS GOING TO KEEP ME FROM
DOZING OFF ON THE TRAIN NOW.
O:
WHAT?! ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT HE HID THOSE WEAPONS AS HIS
BALLS?! AS DANDY GIN'S GOLDEN BALLS?! YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
ALL THE GIN FANS VERY ANGRY. GIN'S A POPULAR ONE, HE IS.
