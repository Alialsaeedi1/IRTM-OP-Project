D: Hello Odacchi, I figured out the tank top you were talking about in
Volume 60 about Chapter 589 , It's"Bound". I's "Dog" and "ND" for
Bound. I also love the Odacchi that forgets things he wrote himself.
P.N. Burdock (* Dogs say "Bau!" instead of "Bark" in Japan, and
Bau sounds like Bov.
O: OHHHHH~-!!!! I see-. That's it!! It's gotta be that! Whew--
how could you tell? Man-, I thought really hard too, but I
couldn't figure it out. Thanks!!

D: OPACCHI, TELL US YOUR FEELINGS (WILL) AS OF NOW IN 3 LETTERS!!
Pen name, Monkey D. Emi
O: IDK (*Note he is answering at the same time by using
3 letters.)
D: My chest is hurting, and my stomach feels like it's about to
puke, but is this the rumored "Haki"? P.N.vlue
O: I see that is "Hakike". (Hakike means Nausea)
D: There's something that ReAaaaaly bothered me so I took a pen for
the first time! And so, the question is Sanj's *BAM*! 2 years later...
IT'S JUST PLAIN OUT THERE!!! And why hide the *GGGGG*?? Please
chouse out of my speculations below!
O Illustration mistake
(2) Image change
3 He's actually a twin named Yonji.
P.N.Aoya
O: I apologize. I couldn't really hear because of the construction nearby,
but Sanji hasn't changed at all, has he? From 2 years ago.. ah! Oh, the
goatee, right? Looks like he let his goatee grow. It looks pretty wild and
pirate-like and I like it a lot. What else.. he has always hidden an eye and.
curled his brows.. didn't say anything new to Luffy and the co. when
they were reunited... Nothing has changed! If I have to chose, I guess ©
if you found anything.
And now from page 182, the seiyu SBS! I will return in the next volume!
