ISN'T THERE
ANYONE ON
THIS SHIP WITH
SOME MEDICAL
KNOWLEDGE?
PANt
EVEN THE
SLIGHTEST
SYMPTOMS CAN
LEAD TO DEATH
IF IGNORED,
EVEN ALL THAT
ONLY GOES SO FAR
AS TO BE CALLED
"NURSING".
WELL, I OBVIOUSLY
PLAN ON GIVING HER
NUTRITIOUS MEALS THAT
ARE EASY ENOUGH TO
DIGEST EVEN FOR A
SICK PERSON BUT.
RIGHT
SANJ!!?
OH I'M
SURE SHE'LL
GET BETTER IF
SHE JUST EATS
SOME MEAT!
IT MAY NOT
ACTUALLY
CURE HER.

mangareader.net300,000
SOLDIERS OF
THE ROYAL
ARMED
FORCES
SWITCHED
SIDES TO
JOIN THE
REBELS!?
WITH THAT, THE
SITUATION IN
ALABASTA HAS
ENTERED ITS
MOST CRITICAL
PHASE.
BUT
NOW THE
SITUATION
IS COM-
PLETELY
OPPOSITE!
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SURPRISED
I MANAGED TO
GET THROUGH
TO YOU SO
WELL
SOUNDS
LIKE AN
EMERGENCY.
UNDERSTAND
LUFFY?
SORRY FOR
NOT SHOWING
IT
TO YOU
LINTIL NOW..
I DIDN'T WANT TO
WORRY YOU ANY
FURTHER SINCE WE
WERE ALREADY
SALING AS FAST
AS WE COULD.
THAT
CAN'T
BE.
ORIGINALLY, THE
600 THOUSAND-
STRONG ROYAL
ARMED FORCES
COULD CONTAIN THE
REBELS WHO WERE
ONLY 400,000
STRONG..
AND
THAT WAS
THE PAPER
FROM 3
DAYS AGO.
ngareadar.netBUT WITH
THE EMERGING
CRISIS IN MY
COUNTRY, I
WANT TO GO
THERE AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.
THAT'S
WHY,
AT THE
FASTEST
SPEED!
I HAVE A
REQUEST TO ASK
ALL OF YOu.
I KNOW
THAT IT'S
NOT MY PLACE
TO MAKE SUCH
DEMANDS
SINCE YOU'VE
ALREADY LET
ME ON THIS
BOAT AND
ALL
NOT EVEN A
SINGLE MOMENT
CAN BE SPARED
ANYMORE!
I ASK FOR
THIS SHIP TO
HEAD FOR
ALABASTA,
mangareader.hetCHAPTER ED
"AT THE FASTEST SPEED"
JANG'S DANCE PARADISE VOL.4 "AFTER HIM. USOPD DEFENCE FORCE!"
mangareader.netDE COURSE!
JUST LIKE WE
PROMISED!
... THUS,
WE NEED TO
FIND AN ISLAND
WITH A DOCTOR
IMMEDIATELY.
AND THEN
HEAD FOR
ALABASTA!
THAT'LL BE THE
ONLY WAY THIS
SHIP CAN SAIL
AT THE FASTEST
SPEED, RIGHT!?
WE HAVE
TO SEE TO
IT THAT NAMI
GETS BETTER
AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE,
mangareader.netEVEN SO,
IT STILL
TASTES
GREAT!
AHAHAHA!
WHAT!
THE LEFTOVER
SCRAPS AND
INGREDIENTS ON
THE VERGE OF
SPOILING ARE
THEN GIVEN
TO YOL..
I ONLY USE
THE FRESHEST
MEATS AND
VEGETABLES TO
COOK A PERFECTLY
BALANCED MEAL
FOR THEM.
I PUT IN 100
TIMES MORE
EFFORT THAN
FOR THE REST
OF YOu LOT.
AND IN THE
FIRST PLACE,
WHEN IT COMES
TO PREPARING
MEALS FOR NAMI
AND VIVI,
I WON'T
KNOW WHAT
TYPE OF MEAL
TO PREPARE
WOULD BE
BEST EITHER.
AND UNLESS
I KNOW WHAT
THAT IS,
SO IF SOMEONE
IS STILL SICK,
THEN THAT'S
BECALISE OF A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
ILLNESS.
THERE
WON'T BE
ANY TROUBLES
RELATED TO
MALNUTRITION
OR SUCH.
IN ANY CASE,
AS LONG AS
I'M THE CHEF
ON THIS SHIP,
F-FORTY
DEGREES!?
NOT HAVING
ENOUGH ENERGY
TO EVEN EAT IS
WHAT WE CALL
BEING SICK IN
THE FIRST PLACE,
YOU IDIOT.
COULDN'T
YOU JUST EAT
EVERYTHING
INSTEAD?
HER FEVER
ROSE AGAIN!
mangareader.netEXACTLY!
THAT'S WHY WE
NEED TO GET NAMI
TO A DOCTOR AS
QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE.
YOU SURE? AREN'T
YOU WORRIED ABOUT
THE LIVES OF A MILLION
ALABASTANS, BEING A
PRINCESS AND ALL?
CAN'T GET
ANY FASTER
THAN THAT!
I'VE
FALLEN
FOR YOU
ALL OVER
AGAIN!
工 LIKE
YOUR
GUTS.
SORRY..
