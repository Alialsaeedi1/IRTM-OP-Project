O: AHH, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ALREADY.
D: WHAT ARE THE PISTOLS IN ONE PIECE CALLED? THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE
MATCHLOCKS.
O:
THEY ARE "FLINTLOCK PISTOLS." THE FLINT IS A SPARK-MAKING STONE, SO
YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS ONE STEP BETTER THAN THE FUSE OF A
MATCHLOCK.

WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, THE COCK
IS RELEASED AND THE FLINT STRIKES THE FRIZZEN,

CLINK!

BECAUSE THIS PISTOL CAN BASICALLY ONLY BE FIRED ONCE,
SOME PIRATES WERE KNOWN TO CARRY AS MANY AS FIVE OR
SIX AT A TIME. BUT IN THE WORLD OF ONE PIECE, THEY HAVE
BEEN IMPROVED SO THAT THEY CAN SHOOT ANY NUMBER OF
TIMES. SCARY.
THE SPARK IGNITES THE
GUNPOWDER AND THE
BULLET IS SHOT OUT.
