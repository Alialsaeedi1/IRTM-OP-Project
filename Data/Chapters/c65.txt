D: YO!! EI-CHAN!! ARE YOU STILL WORKING ON ONE PIECE? KEEP
DRAWING, MAN!! OKAY, EI-CHAN, HERE'S MY QUESTION. WHO ARE
THE "ONE PIECE" CHARACTERS WITH THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST
IQS?! OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.
O: I'LL TELL YOU. BUT WHEN I SAY "IN ONE PIECE," I REALLY MEAN,
"OF ALL THE CHARACTERS INTRODUCED THUS FAR IN ONE PIECE."
AND HAVING CLEARED THAT UP, THE CHARACTER WITH THE HIGHEST
IQ IS SHANKS' FIRST MATE, BENN BECKMAN. HE IS A GREAT
CREWMATE WHO SUPPORTS SHANKS WITH HIS ASTONISHING WISDOM
AND STRENGTH. AND RIGHT AFTER HIM WOULD PROBABLY BE
CAPTAIN KURO, THEN NAMI. NOW AS FOR THE LOWEST IQ... I CAN'T
DECIDE THE WORST ONE. THEY'RE ALL IDIOTS.
D:
ODA-SENSEI, IS YOUR HOUSE REALLY MADE OF CARDBOARD? (I
HEARD FROM MY FRIEND.)
O: YES. WHETHER IT'S RAINY OR SUNNY OR SNOWY, I ALWAYS DRAW
MY MANGA. BUT DON'T WORRY. THE CERTIFICATE INK I USE IS
WATERPROOF!!(CAUTION: GOOD CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BELIEVE ME!)
D:
WHAT IS THAT CAPE-LIKE THING THAT BUCHI OF THE NYABAN
BROTHERS HAS? IS IT A FUTON?
O:
ACTUALLY, IT'S A "KOTATSU-BUTON." HE IS A CAT, AFTER ALL.
(NOTE: A KOTATSU-BUTON IS THE FUTON THAT COVERS A KOTATSU, WHICH IS A TABLE
WITH A HEATER UNDERNEATH. THE COVER KEEPS THE HEAT UNDERNEATH, AND CATS
ARE SAID TO LOVE HIDING UNDER THE KOTATSU WHERE IT IS WARM.)
D: IS LUFFY"S POSE ON THE COVER OF VOLLIME 3 FROM KEN
SHIMURA-SAN'S"AIN"?
O:
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT!! IT'S AlIN!! IT REALLY IS. YES, IT IS
AIlIN
(NOTE: "AIIIN" IS A WELL-KNOWN GAG FROM VETERAN COMEDIAN KEN SHIMURA. KEN'S
MOST FAMOUS CHARACTER IS "BAKA TONO" (STUPID LORD), WHOSE SIGNATURE POSE
IS "AIlIN!")
