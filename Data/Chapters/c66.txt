QNH-RENH
D: DOES SANJI-SAN LIKE SHIT?
O: HE LOVES SHIT.
(IN THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE, SANJI SAYS "KUSO" A LOT WHEN TALKING, A WORD
THAT CAN MEAN ANYTHING FROM DARN TO SHIT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE TRANSLATED
IT AS "DAMN" IN OUR SCANLATION AND SO THIS JOKE WAS LOST IN TRANSLATION.)
D: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MARINES SYSTEM VERY WELL. IS
CAPTAIN THE HIGHEST RANK? IS COBY AT THE HEADQUARTERS?
OR A BASE?? WHERE DOES LIEUTENANT FULLBODY STAND?

THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE
ENTIRE EXPLANATION OF
THE MARINES SYSTEM IN
THE WORLD OF ONE PIECE.
COBY'S BASE IS THE 153TH
BRANCH. OFFICERS OF
THE RANK OF CAPTAIN AND
ABOVE COMMAND THE BASES
SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE
WORLD. I WONDER WHEN
THE DAY COBY ADVANCES TO
BE AN OFFICER WILL COME.
