I'VE BEEN GROWING OKAY HAIR FOR THREE STRAIGHT DAYS.
O: BUGGY? WELL... LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S A CUTOFF POINT.
APPARENTLY, IF HE'S ANY FURTHER AWAY FROM HIS PARTS AFTER
THAT, HE LOSES CONTROL. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SINCE YOU'RE
GROWING OKAY HAIR, WHY DON'T YOU ENTER YOURSELF IN THAT

TWO ISLANDS,
THE VARIOUS
ISLANDS ACROSS

BEFORE YOU
CAN PROGRESS

ALL HAVE
THEIR OWN
