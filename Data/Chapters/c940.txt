A
GIRL NAMED
TOKO, TO THE
CAPITAL
YASU
SOLD
HIS ONLY
DALIGH-
TER.
IT'S NOT
AS GOOD
AS IT SEEMS.
WE GET BARELY
ANYTHING FOR
THE WORK
WE DO.
HE'S GOING
AROUND GIVING
OUT ALL THE
PROVISIONS.
TONOYASLI
SURE HELPS
MAKE THIS
PLACE LIVELY!!
SHE SENDS
MOST OF THE
MONEY SHE
EARNS TO
HIM.
.TOKO
HE THINKS IT WOULD
BE A WASTE TO KEEP ALL
THE MONEY FOR HIMSELF.
SO HE TAKES IT LIPON HIM-
SELF TO PROVIDE PROVISIONS
DAILY TO THOSE WHO
CANNOT WORK.
BECAUSE HE
WAS ABLE TO
SEND TOKO TO
THE CAPITAL
NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,
SHE DID LAUGH A
LOT. JUST LIKE
HIM, TOO.
UN
BUT I'M
NOT A BOY!
AHAHAH!
EVEN IF IT
MEANS THAT HE
WILL GO HUNGRY
IN DOING SO..
AH
THAT GIRL!?
隊店
IIII
ALTHOUGH HE
MIGHT ACT LIKE A
CLOWN MOST OF
THE TIME
HE
IS OUR
SAINT
HE HAS
BEEN LOVED BY
EVERYOME IN THIS
TOWN FOR A LONG
TIME NOW.ALLIANCES
WITHOUT TRUST
MIGHT AS WELL
NOT EXIST.
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN LEAVE THIS IN
YOUR HANDS!!

I WON'T
FORGIVE YOU
FOR DOUBTING
MY COMRADES.
NASTATE OP
(MERGENCY..
BUT YOU
UNDERSTAND WHY
SHE WAS ANGRY,
DON'T YOu?
DAMMIT,
SHINOBL, WHY'D
SHE HAVE TO GO
AND SAY SOME-
THING LIKE
THAT!?
SIGH.
TRA-GLY
GOT UPSET
AND LEFT..
SHE'S BEEN
WAITING FOR 20
LONG YEARS.
I WONDER
IF HE'LL COME
BACK.
WOULDN'T
YOU DO THE
SAME!?
RIGHT... IF YOU
WERE IN THEIR
SHOES RIGHT NOW,
YOU'D HAVE TOLD
THE ENEMY EVERY-
THING!!
I DON'T
BLAME
THEM.
WELL..
EVEN IF BEDO
AND THE OTHERS
DID LEAK OUR
PLAN.
HMM..
IF I WAS BEING
TORTURED... I THINK
† WOULD LAST...
THREE SECONDS,
MAYBE?
THAT
ISN'T LONG
AT ALL!!AND EVEN
THOUGH YASU HAS
BEEN TAKING CARE OF
THEIR EVERY NEED, THEY
HAVE CONTINUED TO BE
PATRONIZING. THEY ARE
TRULY IMPOSSIBLE TO
DEAL WITH.
THEY WERE
TOLD TO LIVE
IN YASU'S
HOUSE.
OH YEAH,
NOW I REMEMBER!
THOSE THREE TRIED TO
CAUSE TROUBLE DURING
THE COURTESAN
PROCESSION!!
Cl
TONOYASU
SURE DOES
ENJOY TAKING
CARE OF
PEOPLE.
EVEN IF THEY
ARE TROUBLE-
SOME!!
50
THAT'S
THEM!!
IT ENDED UP
BEING DISTRIBUTED
INTO THE ENEMY'S
HANDS AS WELL,
SO THE PLAN HAS
BEEN RUINED.
THAT
WAS TO BE
EXPECTED,
I SUPPOSE
MADE US
AWARE OF THE
FINAL BATTLE,
BUT.
IT
IS TRUE
THAT THIS
CARD.
YES
YOU'RE
RIGHT!!
ON THAT NOTE,
I DID NOT KNOW
ABOUT THE WANING
CRESCENT MOON TATTOO
ON THE ANKLE. I AM SURE
THAT THERE ARE OTHERS
WHO DO NOT KNOW
OF IT, AS WELLI
YOU
COULD GO
UP TO THEM
AND SAY "IT
WAS JUST A
PRANK"
BUT
I GUESS
AlL OF OUR
ALLIES WOULD
BELIEVE THAT,
