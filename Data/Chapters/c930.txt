The Witching Hour Boy:
Written as Ushimitsu-kozov (I= 2 ]M) in the original. Ushimitsu
(3rd division of the ox) is part of the traditional japanese time system
(Wadokei) and refers to the time between 2:00-2:30am at night
(varies depending on season, see picture below. It is superstitiously
known as the time when spirits/ghosts are most active. As such,
"Ushimitsu" is commonly found in occult books or horror movies. The
closest equivalent we have in english is the Witching Hour, said to be
the time when ghosts/demonic powers are the strongest. With a
similar (if not same) meaning behind it. It is an appropriate
localisation. The main difference between the two, however, is that the
witching hour traditionally refers to the time between 2:00-4:00am.
which is a bit later than Ushimitsu.
Note that the traditional japanese time system also changes and
varies depending on the season, so giving an exact time-frame can be
difficult.
