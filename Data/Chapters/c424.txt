THIS ATTACK
ABOUT..
.?
ONCE THEY'VE
COMPLETELY
DEMOLISHED
ENIES LOBBY,
IF THEY DON'T
WANT TO KILL
HER, THAT MEANS
THEY'RE STILL
PLANNING TO GET
HER BACK, HUH?
THEY'LL
PROBABLY
COME TO GET
NICO ROBIN
IN CLOSE
COMBAT.
HIS OPPONENT
IS WITHOUT A
DOUBT THAT
"PIGEON GLY,"
ROB LuCCI.
COMING FROM
THE TOP OF
THE BRIDGE'S
FIRST PROP.

THAT'S WHY
THE BRIDGE
HASN'T BEEN
ATTACKED.
I STILL SEE
THE SMOKE
OF THEIR
BATTLE
HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT IT'S THE
ISLAND WE WERE
JUST AT.
NOT TO
KILL NICO
ROBIN.
IT SEEMS
THAT THERE
WAS AN
ORDER
EVERYONE'S ALL WORN
OUT, BUT THERE ARE
STILL MANY STRONG
ONES ON THE SHIPS.
RIGHT!?
WHERE'S
LUFFY
NOW!?IT'S A BAD
IDEA TO GET
INVOLVED IN
THEIR FIGHT
AND GET
SEPARATED.
THAT PIGEON
GUY IS NOT
AN ORDINARY
GuY.
EVEN IF THE
FLEET OF ENEMY
WARSHIPS
COMES AT US,
THE
"STORM" IS
ABOUT TO
COME!!!
THAT'S
WHAT WE
SHOULD DO.
OKAY!!
DON'T
EVEN TRY.
THEY'RE
CLOSE.
WHY DON'T
WE LEND
A HAND?
WE MUST
KEEP OUR
ESCAPE
ROUTE OPEN,
?.
AND WAIT
FOR LUFFY
RIGHT HERE!!

R: Odacchi, hello. I finally realized the secret
of the attacks Zoro uses against kaku in
voluMe 43.
Nigiri -› Nigiri sushi
Tourou - > Toro (Bluefin tuna)
Outourou - > Ohtoro (Fattiest Bluefin tuna)
Hirameki -> Hirame (Flounder)
Samon -> Salmon
I never knew you were this obsessed with
sushi... But has Zoro ever had sushi!?
-Susshi
303
O: Ohohoi ohohoi... That's a false accusation, right, Zoro!7 It pains me that you
would think that we're using ridiculous puns like that! Come on out and let them
know how it is, Zoro!!
2: Hey hey... Listen up, Susshi. Th... That's totally n…. not how it is.
O. What's with that hesitation!!? 3
R: To Oda. Does Santa Claus really exist?
-Kinoko
O: He does!! Of course he does!! I always stay up to try and see him, but I always
fall asleep! Really! It sucks!!
R: Oda!! I have a serious question. Won't you draw Luffy's parents?
-Mr. Uni, 16 years old
O: His parents... they've already been drawn. And they'll appear in the next
volume. Look forward to it-
