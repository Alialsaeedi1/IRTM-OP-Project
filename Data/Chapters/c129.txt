dengreader.net曾問，户
D: I HAVE A QUESTION. ON VOLLIME 12, P. 31, WHAT IS THAT "SAILING
CEREMONY" THEY DO? PEN NAME: VIVI FANCLUB NO. 17
O:
WHAT THEY DID WAS USE THEIR HEELS TO CRACK OPEN A BARREL OF
BEER TO CELEBRATE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE GRAND LINE. YOU
COULD CALL IT A "ONE PIECE-STYLE SAILING CEREMONY." I WANTED
TO DRAW SOME MORE ABOUT IT, BUT I REALLY WANTED TO CALL THE
100TH CHAPTER "THE LEGEND HAS BEGUN," SO I WAS IN A HURRY TO
MAKE ENDS MEET. PRETTY COOL, HUH?
NOW, ABOUT A REAL SAILING CEREMONY:
® BEFORE THEY BEGIN BUILDING THE SHIP, THERE IS A "BUILDING
CEREMONY."
© ONCE THE SHIP IS FULLY BUILT, THERE IS A "COMPLETION CEREMONY."
AND WHEN IT FINALLY GOES TO SEA, THERE IS A GRAND "SAILING
CEREMONY."
IN OTHER WORDS, THE SAILING CEREMONY IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST
EXCITING CELEBRATION OF THE BIRTH OF A SHIP. TO CELEBRATE, YOL
BREAK A BOTTLE OF LIQUOR ON THE BOW OF THE SHIP, AND IF THE
BOTTLE DOESN'T BREAK, THE SHIP IS CURSED WITH BAD LUCK. IT'S A
TIME OF CELEBRATION, BUT THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY DOES THE
BREAKING HAS TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I'VE EVEN HEARD THAT IN
VIKING SAILING CEREMONIES THEY SPILLED BLOOD ON THE SHIP FROM
A LIVE SACRIFICE. YIKES!
It's finished
