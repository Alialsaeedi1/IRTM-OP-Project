STRONG!
10
IS ONE OF
THE OUKA
SHICHIBUKAI!
SIMPLY PLIT,
THEY'RE SEVEN
PIRATES THAT
ARE OFFICIALLY
AUTHORIZED BY
THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT.
AS LONG AS THE
SHICHIBLIKAI GIVE
A PORTION OF THEIR
LOOT, OBTAINED FROM
PILLAGING AND
UNCIVILIZED LANDS,
TO THE WORLD
GOVERNMENT,
THEIR PIRATING
ACTIVITES ARE
OFFICIALLY
SANCTIONED

KNOWLEDGE
THEN HE'D HAVE
COME BACK

OWNER ZEFF
TOLD ME.mangareader.netta
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THE PLACE WE'RE
GOING TO THAT YOLI
HAVE TO KNOW ABOLIT!
THIS IS
EXACTLY
WHAT I'M

ABOUT!
HECK
YEAH!
SO,
SHOULD
WE EAT?
7.
THE REASON WHY
THE GRAND LINE
IS CALLED THE
"PIRATES'
GRAVEYARD."
AND ONE
OF THEM,
IS BECAUSE OF
THE 3 GREAT
POWERS THAT
RULE OVER IT.
