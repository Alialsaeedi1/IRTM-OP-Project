mangareaderne質問
D:
WHY DOES SANJI-SAN'S EYEBROW CURL UP AT THE END? IS IT FOR
FASHION? MAKE IT CLEAR!!
O: HEY!! YOU THERE, SIT DOWN!! NOW LISTEN!! EVERYONE LIVES IN
CIRCLES!! THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE EARTH ALL SPIN IN CIRCLES!!
AND!! IF THE EARTH SUDDENLY STOPPED SPINNING!! THE PLANET
WOULD BE COVERED IN TIDAL WAVES!! IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE!! NOW
REMEMBER THAT SANJI'S EYEBROW CHANNELS THAT SAME POWERFUL
CIRCULAR ENERGY!! REFLECT UPON THIS!! YOU MAY GO!!
D:
A QUESTION. HOW OLD IS SANJI-SAN?
O: 19 YEARS OLD. THE SAME AS ZORO.
D: NAMI, NAMI, NAMI, NAMI, I LOVE NAMI. I WON'T GIVE HER OVER TO THAT
SANJI GUY!! THEREFORE, I PROPOSE A DUEL, FOR NAMI. TOMORROW,
AT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, ON THE RED LINE. BE THERE! ODA-SENSEI,
IS THIS OKAY?
O: OKAY!! FIGHT!!
D: HOW MANY ASSISTANTS DO YOU HAVE? WHAT DO THEY DO?
O:
THERE ARE FOUR. THEY HELP ME WITH THE BACKGROUNDS AND SO
FORTH. THEY STAY AT MY HOUSE AND HELP ME FOR THREE DAYS AND
TWO NIGHTS A WEEK, BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO FINISH A CHAPTER WITHOUT THEM. HOWEVER, IT'S SUCH A
SILLY PLACE WITH ALL OF US TOGETHER THAT DOING THE WORK IS VERY
FUN.
