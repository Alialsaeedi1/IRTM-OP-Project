TOM-
SAN
ALL
THOSE WHO
SUPPORTED
HIS PIRACY,
EVEN A LITTLE,
WILL BE
SEEN AS
DANGEROUS.
TOM'S
GOING
TO BE
EXECUTED
Ill
NORMALLY,
CARPENTERS
ARE NOT CHARGED
FOR THE SHIPS
THEY CONSTRUCT,
BUT THIS IS
IN REGARDS
TO THE PIRATE
KING. THIS
IS SPECIAL
CASE.

RIGHT
NOW
PLEASE
ESCORT
THE
CRIMINAL
YES
dr?
THAT WILL
RUN ON
TRACKS ON
THE SURFACE
OF THE SEA
WITH A DON!
AND THE
FEELINGS OF
THE TOWNS
PEOPLE WHOSE
HEARTS HAVE
GROWN WILD
ARE THE
CONCERN
FOR THIS
SINKING
ISLAND..
THUS,
THIS
EXE-
CLITION.
I AM
DEVELOPING
PLANS FOR
A STEAM
ENGINED
PADDLE
SHIP.
LET'S SAY
THAT THE
REASON
THIS ISLAND
IS 50
DISUSED.
HEY,
WHAT'RE
YOU DOING
?!!
...IS
BECAUSE
OF THE
BAD
TRADE.A
PIECE
OF
WORK.
TOM-
DEAN
SO BE
NICE.
BECOME
SHIP BUILDERS
WHO WILL GO
OUT INTO THE
WORLD.
...FRANKY
CAN'T DO IT!
HE'S CRAZY
TO THE
CORE,
I DON'T
THINK HE'LL
HELP,
THOUGH.
YEAH
!!
TA HA!! !!
ll..!!
HE CAN DO
WHATEVER
HE LIKES.
I THINK
THEY WERE
LIKELY
PIRATES.
WHEN I ASKED,
HE SAID HE WAS
"A BRAT WHO JUST
CAN'T BE BOTHERED
WITH" AND THAT HIS
PARENTS TOSSED
HIM OFF THE SHIP.
YOUl
TWO..
WILL SOME-
DAY.
V
YET
STILL NOT
SHAPED.
HE'S
STURDY
TAHA...
WHEN THE
BLUEPRINT FOR
THE SEA TRAIN
IS FINISHED...
WE'LL START
BUILDING IT.AND IT
WON'T GO
AGAINST
THE
WAVES.
WON'T
NEED REPAIRS.
IT WILL SWAY
A LITTLE BELOW
THE SURFACE OF
THE WATER.
THE SEA
TRACKS
THE TRACKS
WILL JUST BE
DESTROYED
AND THAT'LL
BE THE END!!
I'VE ALSO
THOUGHT UP A DEVICE
BETWEEN THE TRACKS
AND THE PADDLES
THAT WILL MAKE A
DISSONANCE THAT THE
FISH WON'T LIKE.
THERE
WILL BE NO
USE FOR
LOGS.
THE "SEA TRAIN"
WILL ONLY USE
THE TRACKS AS
A GUIDE, LIKE
DRAWING IN A
ROPE.
IT'S ENOUGH
SO THAT THE
TRADE BETWEEN
THE ISLANDS WILL
STABILIZE AND
GROW.
THERE ARE
THREE ISLANDS
THAT WILL BE
CONNECTED.
"SAINT POPLA",
"PUCCHI", AND
"SAN FALDO",
SO THEN, THE
SEA KINGS WILL
HATE THE TRACKS,
AND THEY WON'T
GO NEAR IT.
SOUNDS
WON-
DERFUL
YOU
CAN DO
THAT
!?APP?
WHEN
THE SEA
TRAIN,
PUFFING
TOM

CARRYING
THE
TROUBLED
PEOPLE
..AWAY
FROM THE
DISUSED
AND CLOSED
OFF TOWN,
CROSSED
THE SEA.
ONE PIECEBATTLE
FRANKY
9BUT IT'S
NOT SO
SIMPLE THAT
A NORMAL
SHIPWRIGHT
CAN DO IT.
...IS
WATER
SEVEN'S
HOPE
!!!
THE
BLUEPRINT
WILL BE
DONE
SOON
IT'S
POSSIBLE.
YOUR
HONOR,
CAN YOU
CONNECT
TO ENIES
LOBBY?
THE
"SEA
TRAIN"
INTERACTION
BETWEEN ALL
THE ISLANDS
OF THE
WORLD WILL
CHANGE.
IF THIS
TECHNIQUE
IS COMPLETED
WITH A DON,
AND IT GOES
OVER THE
OCEAN,HE'S JUST
FAIRLY STRAIGHT.
THOUGH THE
STUFF HE MAKES
IS REALLY
DANGEROUS,
HIS SHIP
BUILDING
SKILLS ARE
VERY CLOSE
TO THE
ISLAND'S
WORKERS.
I GOT
TOSSED
DON'T
SAY THAT.
HE'S PART
OF OUR
GROUP.
I
HATE
THAT
GLY!!
OSSAN!!
TAKE ME
IN!!
HE BUILT
A CANNON
OUT OF
SCRAP.
TOMS WORKERS
WE
SHOULD
JUST TOSS
THAT
MORON.
I WAS
SURPRISED
BY THIS
KID WHO
ARRIVED AT
THE SCRAP
ISLANDMAKING THE
ISLAND MORE
AND MORE
ISOLATED,
AND IT HAS
TAKEN THE
PEOPLES'
VIGOR FOR
LIFE.
LET
ME DIE
!!
THE
TRADE
PROBLEMS
AND THE
RISING
SEA
LEVEL
WAS.
KYAA
10 YEARS
AFTER THE
MANUFAC-
TURING
OF THE
SEA TRAIN
BEGAN
DON'T
DO SUCH
A STIPID
THING!!!
SO THEY
SENT THEIR
OWN SHIP TO
GET WOOD
AND 50 DIED
AT SEA.
THERE'RE
NO
MATERIALS.
T THINK
IT'S DUE TO
THE ACCIDENT
LAST MONTH

PRESIDENT
OF THE 4TH

COMPANY.
