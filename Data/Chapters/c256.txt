IF I WERE TO USE A GAME
AS AN ANALOGY TO MAKING
STORYLINES IN MANGA, IT
WOULD BE TETRIS. I TAKE A
BUNCH OF SEPARATE IMAGES
AND MAKE THEM INTO ONE
BOOK. BUT WHEN THAT DOESN'T
WORK OUT TOO WELL, I START
PLAYING TETRIS. I LOOK AT
THE LITTLE BLOCKS FALLING
INTO PLACE, AND I THINK,
"WHEW, TETRIS SURE IS FUN."

INSTINCT.
YOUR
INSTINCT.

BUT THE
ENEMIES ARE
STRONG ENOUGH
TO RIVAL
THE PRIESTS,
SO AFTER 3
HOURS...
THERE WILL
PROBABLY BE
30 FALLEN
FIGHTERS.
SO T'LL SAY
50 REMAINING
THEN
HOW DOES
GOD SEE THIS
SITUATION.
In"
AH!?
ME.
I CAN'T
I DON'T
HAVE A
CLUE,
uM...
THE
3 PRIESTS WILL
SURVIVE, THAT'S
FOR SURE..
THE MILITIA IS
VERY STRONG
TOO, SO THEY
WON'T FALL
EASILY.
THAT
IS AN
OPTIMISTIC
GUESS.

ESTIMATE THE
VIOLENCE OF
THE UPCOMING
BATTLE.
