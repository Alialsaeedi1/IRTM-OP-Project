"DARK KING"
SILVERS
RAYLEIGH!!!
ALL IN ALL,
THERE ARE
GREAT NUMBERS
OF CIVILIANS COMING
AND GOING... AND
MEANWHILE, OUT
AT SEA..
..AS A RESULT OF
WHITEBEARD'S DEATH,
PIRATES HAVE BEGUN
INSTIGATING ONE INCIDENT
AFTER THE NEXT!
AS IF TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE SITLIATION,
THESE THREE HAVE
SUDDENLY APPEARED AT
HEADQUARTERS, STOLEN
A BATTLESHIP..
...AND USED THAT SHIP
TO SAIL A FULL CIRCLE
AROUND MARINEFORD, IN
WHAT IS KNOWN TO MEN
OF THE OCEAN AS THE
"RITE OF BURIAL"!!!
5
FURTHERMORE,
HE SEEMS TO BE
WORKING WITH
THE FORMER
FIRST MATE OF
THE PIRATE KING'S
CREW!!!
MARINFORD IS
CURRENTLY
POPULATED WITH
LABORERS WORKING
TO RESTORE THE
TOWN ITSELF...
ORDINARY CITIZENS
WHO HAVEGATHERED
FROM ACROSS THE
GLOBE TO WITNESS
THE AFTERMATH, AND
HORDES OF REPORTERS
FROMVARIOUS
NATIONS.
THE VAST MAJORITY
OF AVAILABLE
MARINE FORCES
ARE OF NECESSITY
AWAY FROM
HEADQUARTERS.
...AND
SECURITY IS
AT AN ALL-
TIME LOW...
cnet"PARADISE"?
PLEASE,
FORGIVE US!
WE'RE ON OUR
WAY OUT OF
THIS OCEAN
RIGHT NOW!
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
BACK TO YOUR
FAMILIES...?
JUST LET
US RETURN
TO PARADISE
ALIVE!!!
...THEN YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE
IN THE FIRST
PLACE!!!
TO BE FRANK,
I'D EXPECTED MORE
OF THE NEW WORLD...
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS BUNCH
OF COWARDS?
IT'S DO OR DIE
OUT HERE!!!
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THAT KIND
OF RESOLVE,"STRAW
HAT LUFFY
LIVES".
THE NEW
WORLD
THE OX BELL
IS A SACRED
BELL
"SIXTEEN CHIMES TO
THE NEW AGE AT
MARINEFORD".,
.. WHAT
IS THIS "OX BELL"
ANYWAY?
...SITUATED LPON
THE OX ROYCE, A
FAMED BATTLESHIP
FROM ANCIENT
TIMES.
THAT IS THE MEANING
OF THE SIXTEEN
CHIMES... HOWEVER,
IT IS QUITE EVIDENTLY
OUT OF SEASON.
AT THE END AND THE
BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR..
THE BELL IS SOUNDED EIGHT
TIMES TO SEE OUT THE OLD
YEAR, AND EIGHT TIMES
TO SEE IN THE NEW.
IN OTHER WORDS..
THIS SOUNDING OF THE
SIXTEEN CHIMES CAN BE
INTERPRETED AS A TRIBLTE
TO THE ENDING OF ONE AGE,
AND THE BEGINNING
OF A NEW.
WISHIR
AS SUCH, THIS MARINE
TRADITION INVOLVES
SOUNDING THE
BELL SIXTEEN TIMES
IN FULL,
„ mangareadernetAND FINALLY,
STANDING BEFORE
THE WAR SCARS
THAT ARE STILL
EVIDENT IN THE
PLAZA...
.HE SCATTERED
FLOWERS THERELPON,
AND ENGAGED IN A
FLAGRANT MOMENT OF
"SILENT PRAYER" ....!!
THIS ARTICLE
HAS ALREADY
BEEN DISTRIBUTED
AROUND THE
ENTIRE WORLD!
INCLUDING
THE FACT THAT WE
ALLOWED HIM TO SLIP
RIGHT THROUGH OUR
FINGERS...!! THIS IS
A DISGRACE!!
TO SOUND THAT
BELL SIXTEEN FULL
TIMES CAN ONLY
SERVE AS A
DECLARATION
OF WAR!!
Vouds
MONKEY D LUFFY
THEN PROCEEDED
TO COMPOLIND
THIS AUDACITY BY
ENTERING THE
PLAZA ALONE...
AND UPON REACHING
THE "OX BELL" ON
ITS WESTERNMOST
EDGE, HE SOUNDED
IT A FULL SIXTEEN
TIMES..
THE REPORTERS
PRESENT, NATURALLY,
SNAPPED THE WHOLE
SCENE UP EAGERLY.
AND AS SUCH...
AT A GLANCE, OF
COURSE...
. THIS COULD BE
SEEN AS A FORM OF MEMORIAL
SERVICE FOR HIS BROTHER,
WHITEBEARD, AND THE OTHERS
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES
IN THE WAR.
THIS WOULD EXPLAIN
THE SILENT PRAYER AND
THE RITE OF BURIAL, BUT AS
FOR THE SIXTEEN CHIMES.
PROPER OBSERVANCE OF A
TRAGIC EVENT INVOLVES
ONLY TWO CHIMES!!
„ mangareader.netAND HE'S
TRYING TO SAY
"T'LL CREATE THE
NEW AGE MYSELF"
OR SOMETHING,
IS HE..
?
HAHAHAHAH...!!
MAN, THAT KID
GETS ON MY
NERVES.
BUT I' M NOT FOOL
ENOUGH TO LET
HIM HOLD ON TO
THAT ADVANTAGE
FOR TOO LONG.
THE END OF
WHITEBEARD'S
AGE..
OF RETURNING TO THE PLACE
WHERE HE LOST HIS BROTHER,
WILFULLY REOPENING HIS OWN
FRESH WOUNDS, UNLESS HE
HAD A GRAND PURPOSE
OF THAT NATURE.
I HARDLY
THINK HE WOULD
GO TO THE
TROUBLE...
16
OKAY, SO AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE WAR, HE'S
CLEARLY MADE
HIMSELF STAND
OUT FROM THE
REST OF US
ROOKIES.ARE YOU
SERIOUS? THE

wangareadernetD: Hello!! I have something I want to ask youl! Robin is always cool and
awesome... even at Thriller Bark, she was the only one who was too
embarrassed to do the docking... if that was you, would you reject the
offer? P.N.I love Zoro and Robin (3
Y: It's embarrassing but I want to do it... so "HALF DOCKING!!'
D: To Miss Yuriko Yamaguchi: ARE YOU... MY MOTHER?!
P.N. OUR CURTAINS STINK.
Y: From now on...
. "WASH MY CURTAINS TO THE FULLEST FOR
ME!!! (* from "From now on.. LIVE YOUR
LIFE TO THE FULLEST FOR ME!!!" by Olvia.)

D: Hello! The OP voice actors seem to do everything in reality, but
does that go for you too? Does this mean that when Franky
became a Strawhat, you "grabbed" Mr. Yao's thing?!
P.. Natsutomo
it
Y: Well, yes, I do do everything in reality as a OP voice
actor... So to the unwilling Mr. Yao, (Franky's voicer)
"GRAB!' with force!! Mr. Yao, sorry back then.
D: Can you possibly tell me the recipe of the takoyaki you make?
P.N. Mujonn
Y: Flour and water, eggs, octopus, ginger, fry crumbs, Taro
potatoes (a little), salt (a little), seasoning (a little), soy sauce
(a little)
Making of: Mix the water and flour, and add the Taro potatoes, salt, seasoning,
and soy sauce little by little. Pour oil on the fryer, and put the octopus in the shape,
adding the rest of the ingredients. Looking closely so it doesn't burn, turn the takoyaki
in the fryer. Coating with sauce is good, eating with soup is also good.
D: To the friend-loving Robin (Miss
Yamaguchi), I ask you. Can you draw
the Strawhat crew? P.N. Lemonski

O: Ok, time is pretty much up,
good work Miss Yuriko - ! Hm?
What the heck is this drawing?!

mangareadernetTHE LAY OF
POWER AMONGST
THE PIRATES,
TOO, SHOULD BE
UNDERGOING
CHANGE.
WE SHOULD
FIRST WAIT TO
SEE HOW THE
NEW WORLD
RESPONDS
HOW WILL WE
GO ABOLIT FILLING
THE THREE EMPTY
SEATS IN THE
SHICHIBUKA?
THE BALANCE
BETWEEN THE
THREE GREAT
POWERS HAS
FALLEN INTO A
TERRIBLE STATE.
IT HELD THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF
REPRESENTING
INTERRACIAL
HARMONY... HIS
SORELY FELT.
WE MUST
SELECT
ONLY THOSE
INDIVIDLIALS
WITH GREAT
INFLUENCE.
IT IS ALWAYS THOSE
WITH THE D WHO CAUSE
SUCH TROUBLE... JUST
LIKE PORTGAS...
...HE HAS A CLEAR HEAD
START, THERE IS, AFTER ALL,
NO RECORD OF ANY MAN
BEFORE HIM SUCCESSFULLY
CONSUMING TWO DEVIL'S
FRUITS.
AMONGST THOSE
PIRATES STRIVING TO
FILL THE VACANT SEAT
IN THE YONKOU..
IF ANYBOOY
CAN PUT A STOP
TO HIS ADVANCE,
IT WOULD HAVE
TO BE THE YONKOLI
THEMSELVES.
IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THE NAME HAS BECOME
RATHER TOO EXPOSED
AT THIS POINT...
...OR ELSE MARCO THE
PHOENIX AND THE
OTHER REMNANTS OF
THE WHITEBEARD
PIRATES.
AND JUMBEI
TOO HAS FINALLY
DECIDED TO OPPOSE
uS...
WHEN WE
INDUCTED HIM INTO
THE SHICHIBUKAI,
I HARDLY
EXPECT HIM TO
COME OLIT INTO
THE OPEN AFTER
ALL THIS TIME..
WHAT MANNER
OF CONNECTION
DOES THE BOY
HAVE WITH
RAYLEIGH...
...IT'S JUST ONE THING AFTER
ANOTHER WITH THIS STRAW HAT
LUFFY BOY. ...IT SEEMS ODOLY
APPROPRIATE THAT HE IS
GAR'S GRANDSON...
HE IS ALL TOO
FAMILIAR WITH
THE TERRITORY
THAT WHITEBEARD
CONTROLLED.
..AND ONE OF
THOSE ROCKIES
EXCEEDING A HUNDRED
MILLION IN BOUNTY
HAS ALREADY FALLEN
PREY TO HMM.

HAS ALREADY
BEGUN TO TAKE
ACTION IN THE

Because IT'LL COME IN SUPER HANDY! P.N. Encounter with Nagisa
Y: I'm alike with Robin since I look cool when I'm quiet. The fruit I want is
