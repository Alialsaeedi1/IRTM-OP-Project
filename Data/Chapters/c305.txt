YEARS TO
EVERY
REACH
YEAR,
THEM.
HM... NOT
REALLY.
IF I HAVE A
HOOORSE.
SINCE YOU
WERE ON THE
STILT FOR 10
YEARS.
HM... IF THEY
STAY ON EACH
ISLAND FOR 3
YEARS, THEN IT
WILL PROBABLY
TAKE 30 YEARS
TO GO AROUND
ONCE.
IT'LL TAKE
AT LEAST
20 YEARS
FOR YOU
TO RELINITE
WITH YOUR
PEOPLE !!
WE ALWAYS
USE THEM TO
CARRY US
AND ALL OUR
BELONGINGS
ACROSS THE
SEA.
WITHOUT
THEM, WE CAN
NEVER MOVE
FAST ENOUGH
TO BEAT THE
TIDES.
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO
CROSS THE LAND
BRIDGES WITHOUT
THE HOOORSES.
YES. THEY ARE THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
ON THIS ISLAND. THE
GRACEFUL WAY THEY
RAN ON THE FIELD IS
FANTASTIC, AND..
OHNNN
A HOOORSE
!!?
BECAUSE
THESE TEN
ISLANDS ARE
ACTUALLY ONE
BIG ISLAND IN
THE FIRST
PLACE.
FURTHER MORE,
THE ETERNAL
POSTS WON'T
HELP YOU GO
FROM ONE LONG
ISLAND TO THE
NEXT..
WE HAVE
NO SAILING
SKILLS..
CAN'T YOU
JUST USE
A SHIP ?
WON'T YOU
BE VERY
LONELY...?
IT IS FINE
I CAN JUST
WAIT HERE
FOR 20
YEARS
