OAH-iENH
D: IN "MONKEY D. LUFFY," WHAT DOES THE D STAND FOR?! IS IT
"DONBURI" (A BOWL)? OR MAYBE "DAIBUTSU" (GIANT BUDDHA
STATUE)? OR MAYBE...!! I'M REALLY CURIOUS. PLEASE TELL ME.
O:
I'VE GOTTEN A RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF THESE LETTERS... SO
MANY. BUT I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I CAN'T ANSWER
IT YET... PLEASE JUST READ IT AS "D" AND DON'T THINK TOO
DEEPLY INTO IT, FOR NOW.
D:
WHAT THE IS CONNECTION BETWEEN PIRATES AND RUM? WHY IS
THAT EVERY BOOK MENTIONS PIRATES AND RUM TOGETHER IN
THE SAME SENTENCE?
O: IT'S NOT JUST PIRATES AND RUM, BUT SAILORS AND RUM. IN
SHORT, RUM IS CHEAP. BECAUSE OF THAT, BACK IN THE SAILING
DAYS OF ENGLAND, THE LIQUOR THEY SUPPLIED THE NAVY
CHANGED FROM BRANDY TO RUM, AND THE IMAGE OF HARD-
DRINKING MEN OF THE SEA BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH RUM. AS
FOR WHY THEY WOULD TAKE SO MUCH LIQUOR, IT WAS BECAUSE
THE WATER WOULD GO BAD ON LONGER VOYAGES.
D: LAST NIGHT, I MET A GUY FROM THE PLANET GOMU GOMU.
WHEN I ASKED HIM, "HOW FAR CAN YOU STRETCH YOUR ARM?"
HE SAID "705 POISON GOMU GOMUS." HOW MUCH IS 705
POISON GOMU GOMUS?
O: YOU MET SOMEONE FROM THE GOMU GOMU PLANET?! WOW!!
THAT'S GREAT!! A "POISON GOMU GOMU" IS 10 TIMES AS MUCH
AS A "GOMU GOMU." SO IN OTHER WORDS, 7,050 GOMU
GOMUS!! THAT'S AN ASTRONOMICAL LENGTH!! BUT BE CAREFUL
GOMU GOMUNS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR GIVING THE MOST
RIDICULOUS ANSWERS IN THE UNIVERSE.
