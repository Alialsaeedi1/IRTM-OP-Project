ner.netTHE SUPER-
EXPRESS SPEED
SHRIMP IS GOD'S
SERVANT.
ANYTHING IT
TRANSPORTS IS
ALWAYS A SACRIFICE
FOR GOD.
TO THE
"SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR.
NAMI-SAN AND
ROBIN-CHAN
AND THE
OTHERS WILL
BECOME
SACRIFICES!!?
SACRIFICES
FOR THAT
GOD!!?
WHERE ARE
THEY GOING?
1200
IN OTHER
WORDS, THEY
ARE GOING
TO THE
NORTHEAST
PORTION OF
UPPER YARD.
SACRIFICES
!!?
er.netTHERE IS ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET
THERE, AND IT'S
VIA THE MILKY
ROAD FROM THIS
ISLAND
SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR
YOU MUST USE
THE DIAL BOAT
AND PASS
THROUGH THE
FOREST, WHERE
THE PRIESTS
RESIDE.
UPPER YARD
THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THIS
OLD MAP AND THE
CURRENT GOD'S
ISLAND IS THE
ADDITION OF THE
MILKY ROADS.
THOSE CLOUD
RIVERS?
YES, I HEARD THAT
THERE IS A MAIN
CLOUD RIVER AS
WELL AS HUNDREDS
OF OTHERS.
I SEE...SO IF WE
LAND DIRECTLY.
WE WOULD GET
BLOCKED BY THE
RIVERS.
YES. ALSO, IN
THOSE RIVERS
THERE ARE
MAN-EATING
FISH.
THIS MAP IS VERY
OLD...BUT IT LOOKS
CORRECT...
HERE IS
WHERE YOU
ARE
ANGEL BEACH
THE SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR IS IN THE
UPPER LEFT, WHICH
IS THE NORTHEAST.
AH. MISTER, WHAT
IF WE GO AROUND
THE ISLAND
INSTEAD OF
THROUGH IT!?
NO...YOU CAN'T GET
TO THE ALTAR ON
FOOT IF YOU LAND
NEAR IT.
SO OTHER THAN
ENTERING VIA THE
CENTRAL MILKY
ROAD, THERE IS NO
OTHER WAY.THEY'RE
CHASING US
WITH THEIR
HUGE MOUTHS
OPEN!!
EVEN IF WE
JUMP, WE
WON'T
SURVIVE
SO INSTEAD
OF SENDING
PURSUERS.
THEY MAKE US
COME TO
THEM.
SUCH
CUNNING
BASTARDS.
SANJI-KUN
YOU MEAN
"HEAVEN'S
JUDGEMENT®
MAYBE...
IT'S
STARTED!
USOPP...!!
IT'S
USELESS.
WHATEVER
WE DO.
LUFFY~~
THOSE
GIGANTIC
SKY FISH..
WHAT IF WE
JUST TAKE
DOWN THE
BIG
SHRIMP!??
THEN WE'RE
GOING TO
THAT ISLAND
AGAIN!!?

WHITE SEA, AND
THEN HEAD TO
THE FAR EAST-•
CLOUD
END.
..!?WHAT,
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN!?
SKY
OCEAN IS
VERY
BIG.
--YES
ALTHOUGH…I
DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD
TRY TO RUN.
