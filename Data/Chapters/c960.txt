CULMINATED
WHEN HE WAS
CAPTURED AT
AGE 10, AFTER HE
NEARLY KILLED
SOMEONE
HE
CLIMBED THE
RANKS AT THE
QUARRY UNTIL HE
WAS RUNNING
THE PLACE!!
HE
TRULY IS
A MEMBER OF
THE KOZUKI
FAMILY!!
BUT THAT ONLY
LEAD TO THE CAPITAL
GETTING FLOODED, SO
HIS CAPTURE WAS
ORDERED.
HOWEVER,
LORD ODEN
JUST FOLLOWED
THAT WATER ROUTE
AND ATTEMPTED TO
ESCAPE OUT TO SEA.
BUT IN THE END,
THAT VOYAGE WAS
SHORT LIVED!!
SO HE
DIVERTED A
RIVER STRAIGHT
INTO THE
CAPITAL.
AND
PRACTICALLY
STARTED A
WAR WITH
THEM!!
HE
RETALIATED BY
SETTING THEIR
CASINO ON
FIRE
HE WAS
SENTENCED TO
HARD LABOUR
IN THE STONE
QUARRY..
WHERE
HE SHOWED
OFF MORE OF
HIS UNIQUE
TALENTS!!
THE
WELLS HAD
DRIED UP. AND
COUNTLESS
PEOPLE WERE
SUFFERING,
BUT
AFTER THAT, HIS
ATTITLIDE CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY.
WHEN
HE WAS
14 YEARS OLD,
THE CAPITAL WAS
EXPERIENCING
A PROLONGED
DROUGHT!!OW, OW, OW, OW,
OWWWWw!! STOP IT,
TSURUJO! THINK OF
OUR CHILDHOOD
FRIENDSHIP!
KIN'EMON!!
I WILL
RIP OUT
YOUR ORGANS
AND SELL THEM

YOUR DEBT!
IF YOU
EVER TOUCH
MY MONEY
AGAIN.
HOW MANY
TIMES HAVE
I LOANED
YOU MONEY
NOW!?
...UH, THANKS
FOR THE MEAL,
O-TSURU! THE
MONEY IS ON
THE TABLE...
DID
YOU STEAL
MONEY FROM
MY WALLET
AGAIN!?
YOUR "BIG
BROS"!? I BET
THEY GAMBLED
THEIR MONEY
AWAY!!
MY
BIG BROS
HAVE BEEN
HAVING MONEY
ISSUES!!
IF YOU
CANNOT AFFORD
TO PAY ME BACK...
THEN I WILL STRIP
YOU OF ALL YOUR
BELONGINGS AS
REPAYMENT!!THE
WORK OF THE
DEVIL.
...AND
EVENTUALLY
FORMED A
HAREM
EVERY
NIGHT,
HE WOULD
KIDNAP WOMEN
FROM THE
CAPITAL.
THEN, AT
AGE 15, WHILE
HE WAS IN HIDING
HE GOT A JOB AT
A TEMPLE DEEP IN
THE MOUNTAINS.
EVEN
THOUGH THE
GIRLS TECHNICALLY
CHOSE TO STAY OF
THEIR OWN FREE
WILL.
KYAHA
HAHA!
WAHA

THAT
EVENT CAME TO
BE KNOWN AS
THE HAREM
REVOLT!!
BUT LORD
ODEN STOOD
HIS GROUND AND
EAGERLY TOOK
THEM ON!!
THEIR
PARENTS, SPOUSES
AND EVEN POWERFUL
SAMURAI ATTEMPTED
TO RESCUE
THEM!!
THEIR LOVED
ONES WERE
ENRAGED!!
EVEN THE
HYOLIGORO
FAMILY GOT
DRAGGED INTO THE
FREY AFTER FAILING
TO PREVENT THE
FIGHTING!!

IT TO DEATH!!
HE
REALLY HAS
LIVED QUITE THE
EVENTFUL
LIFE.
EVEN AS A BABY,
WHEN HE WAS LESS
THAN A YEAR OLD, HE
MANAGED TO FLING HIS
WET NURSE ACROSS
THE ROOM.
BY AGE SIX,
HE WAS ROAMING
