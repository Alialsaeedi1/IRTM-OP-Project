D: If Sanji becomes the president, what would his politics be? P.N. Kenichi
(Aichi area)
O: Yes, let's see-. First would be "ladies first". He'd make the whole
political organization would be composed of beautiful women.
There would be a law that only ladies can eat good food, in movie
theaters, the # of ladies' days would increase to 6 days a week,
there would be total discrimination toward men, and the men
would form a rebellion, and he would fail, losing his position.
D: Hello Oda sensei. No matter how many times I look at Volume 57s cover, I
don't see the 8th division commander Namur. Did something happen to him?!
Give him a chance in the SBS! P.N.Jozu
O: Ah-. that's true-. But in reality, I did draw him. Looks like he got
cut off because of a printing problem. In the original I drew, he's
right here-. Sometime in the future. I'll make sure he is on the color
walks, etc. My apologies, commander Namur!
D: If you take away the cuteness from Chopper,
what would happen?! Please attempt to draw him!!
Ah, and what do your curtains smell like, Mr. Oda?
P.N. Our curtains stink.
YOUR CURTAINS
SMELL LIKE SHIT
YOu BITCH...
Idiot. how
can I by
munchin on
sweets. Where's
the beer. eh?
The beer...
O: Well yes-. The curtains in my workplace are
lavenderish.….. or floralish….. or rosy-ish, or
crappy-ish...
D: You know the coat that all those commissioned Marine
officers wear on their backs? The one that says "Justice".
That thing never falls of no matter how much the guy wearing
it moves, but how does it stay on? A snap stopper? Or maybe
super glue? My husband says "it's rubber" (making it a circle
and passing it through another circle). P.N. Koteni-
O: Too bad, nothing is on there. That is a coat that has Justice" on the back.
It never falls off, because to them, Justice never "falls!! As long as that
feeling stays in their hearts, THE COAT WILL NEVER FALL!!!
