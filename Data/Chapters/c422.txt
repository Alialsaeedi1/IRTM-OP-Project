O: No I'm not!!! )l
R: Oda, I have a question. In volUMe 42, chapter
405 "Power," when Franky uses the "Homing
Cannonball Destroy Cannon," "BF 36" is written
on his shoulders. Does that stand for Battle
Franky #367 Is that right?
-SogeQ
O: Yes...!! That's right. That's how it is. Just like you
surMised from reading the Franky flashback
Chapters, Franky's battleships were completed
Up to #35. And when the ships he built hurt the
people important to him, he repaired his own body
with his engineering skill and made it into Battle
Franky #36 and stopped building battleships.
After that, he founded his scrap house.
