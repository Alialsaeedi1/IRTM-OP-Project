BUGGY, "THE GLOWN PIRATED
THE PROCESS OF GETTING
ON THE STAGE!!
Part 2
* REGARDING PAGE 136. (OP023-20.JPG)
THAT WAS BUGGY'S PIRATE CREW SECOND
DESIGN. BUGGY'S DESIGN AT THAT TIME
AND CURRENT DESIGN, AREN'T THAT MUCH
DIFFERENT, THAT IS WHY HE WASN'T
INCLUDED THERE.
* WHY IS ZORO THERE?
WHY? WELL...
. ON MY ORIGINAL DESIGN,
ZORO WAS PART OF BUGGY'S FLEET
WORKING AS A BODYGUARD. BUT AFTER
THINKING THROUGH MANY PROBLEMATIC
ASPECTS, I DECIDED TO DROP THAT IDEA
* HACHI THE MESSAGE CARRIER
HE'S A FAST "CARRIER PIGEON" USED BY THE
BUGGY PIRATE FLEET TO PASS MESSAGES
IT'S ACTUALLY A TYPE OF BIRD CALLED THE
"O-PO"
AND IT LIVES IN THE "GRAND LINE"
