WELL THEN,
TAKE CARE
AT THE VERY
LEAST, THE

THAT THE
BIG-NAME ROOKIES
ARE ON THE

IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU ROOKIES

LUCKY.
BUT IT'S
ALL RIGHT.
AS LONG AS
NO MAJOR
PROBLEMS
ARISE,
THE MARINES
WON'T COME
IN FORCE.THEY EVEN
SWAGGER
AROUND IN THE
LAWLESS ZONE...
WHAT TROUBLE-
SOME PEOPLE
NOTHING FOR
US TO DO
OTHER THAN
SIT AROUND
AND WAIT FOR
THEM TO PASS.
WHERE ON

THEY GO?
WE WILL MEET
