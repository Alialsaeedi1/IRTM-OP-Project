"HISTORY"
IS...
AN
ASSET TO
HUMANITY.
I'M SURE IT
WILL SHED
SOME LIGHT
ON THE
FUTURE THAT
YOU'LL BE
LIVING.
IT'S NOT
THAT OHARA
WANTED TO
REVEAL THE
HISTORY.
WE JUST
WANTED TO HEAR
THE VOICES
FROM THE PAST
AND PROTECT
THEM.
BUT EVEN
IF OHARA
PERISHES,
PRO-
TECT
THE
BOOKS
PUT
OUT
THE
FIRE!!
THAT YOU'VE
INHERITED
FROM THE
PAST, OTHER-
WISE IT'LL
DISAPPEAR.
ROBIN
IF YOU ARE
A SCHOLAR
OF OHARA,
YOU SHOULD
KNOW IT
WELL.
BUT YOU
HAVE TO
PASS ON
THE HISTORY
OUR
RESEARCH
WILL END
HERE.
