THE 1OTH VOLUME. 2 YEARS SINCE
SERIALIZATION. 2 YEARS, HUH..
2 YEARS WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR
THE 24 YEAR OLD SAZAE-SAN TO
TURN.
24. AH, NOW THAT I THINK
ABOUT IT, I'M THE SAME AGE AS
SAZAE-SAN NOW. AND I USED TO BE
THE SAME AGE AS KATSUO-KUN
BEFORE. WHO'S NEXT? NORISUKE-
SAN? TAIKO-SAN? TARA-SAN? TARA-
SAN, SOMETHING ABOUT HIM JUST
MAKES ME LALIGH. OR IKURA-SAN.
THE HECK AM I TALKING ABOUT?
IN ANY CASE, I'M STILL THE SAME
OLD ME WHO NEVER WORKS AND
DOES NOTHING BUT DRAW MANGA.
