The Wano Region Names:
As you may have noticed, all the major regions of Wano Country are based
on food names. They are spelt slightly differently though, in order to make it
sound more like a location.
Ringo (After Bell Ring) = Apple
Kibi (Unusual Beauty) = Kibi Dango
Kuri (Nine Stretches) = Chestnut
Hakumai (White Dance) = White Rice
Udon (Rabbit Porcelain) = Soup Noodles
It is also interesting to note that although the mountain is called Mt. Fult, it
is written differently in Japanese compared to the real life version.

THE
TYPICAL LOGIC
OF THIS KIND OF
SITUATION DOESN'T
APPLY TO MAMA,
YOU FOOLS!!
WHAT!?.
•BY
KAIDOL...!?
ISN'T IT VERY
LIKELY THAT THE
ENEMY PULLED HER
OUT AND TOOK HER
PRISONER!?
SHE'S AN
ABILITY USER.
AND SHE FELL
INTO THE
SEA...
KINOOOH
PON-
IF THAT WERE TO
HAPPEN, THEN THE
"BIG MOM PIRATES"
WOULD BE RENAMED AS
THE "PEROSPERO
PIRATES"
EVEN THOUGH
I'M SURE
THOSE TWO WERE ONCE
HE'D JUMP AT PART OF THE SAME CREW.
ANY CHANCE TO
THEY'RE NOW EMPERORS
TAKE HER
WHO WOULD LOVE TO
LIFE.

DEAD.

NO DOLIBT
THAT SHE WILL
RETURN
TO US!!

SHE'S DEAD!!IF ANY OF
YOU ASSISTED
HIM OR HAVE ANY
INFORMATION ON
HIS ESCAPE, STEP
