YOU REALLY

THE DAYS OF
"BUGGY THE CLOWN"
HAVE COME TO
AN END.........
IMPEL DOWN IS THE
WORLD'S GREATEST
GAOL, IMPOSSIBLE
TO INFILTRATE,
IMPOSSIBLE
TO ESCAPE.
We'll never
stop following
Captain
Buggy!!!
That's right! Until the
day we find the Treasure
Island of Captain John
we've been searching
for all this time.
He's not the
kind of man
who would let
a thing like
this finish
him off!!!
That's just
not true!!!
Cap'n Buggy
iS.....!!!
Grrrrrr!!
mangareader.netCOME TO THINK
OF IT - I TOLD
LUFFY ABOUT
HIS FATHER.
OH,
YES.
HE WAS RATHER
SURPRISED TO
LEARN THAT HE
EVEN HAD ONE!
AHH, I DO WISH
YOLI AND LUFFY
HAD BECOME
GREAT MARINE
OFFICERS LIKE
I WANTED
YOU TO.
TO THINK THAT
YOu WOULD BOTH
DO THE VERY
OPPOSITE AND
BECOME TERRIBLE
ROGUES.........!!

It doesn't matter
whether... we know it
or not... the fact
rEmains that both
Luffy and I.

..have the blood of a
global-scale criminal
flowing through our veins..
how could mE possibly
bEcomE IllarinEs.......

WELL, I
SUPPOSE THAT
MAKES SENSE...
THAT GUY BEING
HOW HE IS..
I don't have
any mEmoriES...
or any
debt to him
whatsoever...
..I don't care
one jot for that
half of my blood
that came from
my uSElESS
father...
I took the
namE "Portaas"
from my mocher,
whom I owE a
