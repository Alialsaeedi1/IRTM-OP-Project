mangareader.netR: MY QUESTION IS, IN THE FIFTH PANEL OF PAGE
170 IN VOLUME 41, THERE'S A BOOK THAT OLBIA
AND THE OTHERS ARE TOSSING OUT! IT'S THE
BOOK TITLED "BRAG MEN"!! IS THAT THE SAME
BOOK THAT NAMI WAS LOOKING FOR ON PAGE
142 OF VOLUME 13!? THEY'RE THE SAME, RIGHT!?
RIGHT...!? OKAY, I SAID IT 3 TIMES. IF IT'S NOT,
THEN I'M GONNA GO RING SOMEONE'S DOORBELL
AND RUN AWAY.
-P*N SOGEQUEEN & *
O: OHH. I'M SURPRISED. THANK YOU FOR READING SO
CLOSELY. THAT'S AMAZING. YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
VOLUME 41
THAT'S THE SAME BOOK THAT HAD INFORMATION
ABOUT THE "GIANT ISLAND LITTLE GARDEN."
"BRAG MEN" (PEOPLE WHO TELL LIES) HAS BEEN
READ BY MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, AND
IS ALSO KNOWN AS "GRAND LINE ADVENTURES."
THESE EXPLORERS TRAVELED THAT MYSTERIOUS
SEA, AND WROTE ABOUT THE UNBELIEVABLE
DUON
beNg
ISLANDS, PEOPLE, AND EVENTS THAT THEY SAW.
BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
COULDN'T BELIEVE THEIR WORDS, AND SO THEY MOCKED THESE MEN
AND GAVE THE BOOK THAT TITLE. THE BOOK LIVES ON NOW, AND 20
YEARS AGO, THE SCHOLARS OF OHARA GAVE THEIR LIVES TO
PRESERVE THE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE. THINKING ABOUT THAT MAKES
MY HEART SWELL WITH HEATED FEELINGS. AND WERE THE MEN
CALLED "BRAG MEN" REALLY LIARS? THAT IS UP TO YOU TO JUDGE
WITH YOUR OWN EYES AS THE STRAWHATS' ADVENTURE CONTINUES
SEE YOU NEXT VOLUME IN SBS!!!
VOLUME 13
R: ODA!! HELLO! MY QUESTION IS... WAIT, SBS IS ALREADY OVER!!
