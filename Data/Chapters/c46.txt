HOLD ON A MINUTE, IS GAIMON-SAN MY FATHER? (I CHECKED WITH THE
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION)
O:
AHH! DAMN, YOU FOUND OUT... YOU CHECKED WITH THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION... SO THAT'S HOW YOU FOUND OUT... GAIMON-SAN WAS
TOLD TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT ABOUT THIS, BUT... LOOKS LIKE WE
CAN'T HIDE IT ANYMORE. VERY WELL! GO SEE HIM! THAT'S RIGHT, YOU
ARE GAIMON-SAN'S SON! GO AND JUMP INTO GAIMON-SAN'S HEART!
JUMP WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH! AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, GO JUMP I

WHEN I TOLD MY FRIEND, "BUGGY IS 500000 CUTE" SHE TOOK A STEP
BACK AND CALLED ME A
"WEIRDO"! AM I WEIRD?
O: YOU ARE WEIRD!!
„BUT I LIKE BUGGY TOO. AND I'M NOT WEIRD, AM I?
..I'M SPECIAL. I'M A SPECIAL EXCEPTION.
D: PLEASE GIVE ME GAIMON-SAN.
O: HERE YOU GO. OH... YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH HIS SON FIRST,
THOUGH.

WHEN AN ARTIST IS DRAWING CHAPTER 10, FOR EXAMPLE , WHAT
CHAPTER IS BEING PRINTED IN THE NEWEST WEEKLY JUMP?
O: I SEE. I WONDERED ABOUT THIS MYSELF, YEARS AGO. SO I
UNDERSTAND YOUR CURIOSITY. AT THIS EXACT MOMENT, ISSUE 46 OF
JUMP IS HITTING THE STANDS. IT CONTAINS ONE PIECE CHAPTER 60,
"SOLUTION". BUT I HAVE FINISHED THE DRAFTS UP THROUGH CHAPTER
63, "I AIN'T GONNA DIE". SO A CHAPTER COMES OUT ROUGHLY 3
WEEKS AFTER I FINISH IT. BUT THAT'S ONLY MY CURRENT SCHEDULE.
THE PEOPLE DOING THESE WEEKLY SERIALS AREN'T ACTUALLY ALL THE
SAME. I COULD CHANGE IF NEED BE. THERE ARE VARIOUS CASES.
