THE TRUTH
I'VE NEVER
SEEN A SKY
ISLAND,
IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR A SHIP
TO GO UP,
CAPTAIN,
GAH!
BUT HOW
TO GET UP
THERE.
WHAT YOU
SHOLLO
WORRY ABOUT
RIGHT NOW
IS NOT THE
LOCK POST.
NO
MISS
NAVI-
GATORHE MUST
HAVE DIED OF
SICKNESS WHILE
VOYAGING, HIS
TEETH ARE STILL
INTACT UNLIKE THE
REST OF HIS
SKULL
AT THE
AGE OF
ABOUT
30
THAT'S RIGHT,
HE DIEO
AROLIND
200 YEARS
AGO,
FOUND IT. SAINT
BREEZE FROM THE
KINGDOM OF BREEZE
IN SOUTH BLUE,
IT SET SAIL 208
YEARS AGO.
FROM THAT
POINT OF
HISTORY, THIS
SHIP MUST HAVE
BEEN USED FOR
EXPLORING.
HE MAY
NOT BE ABLE
TO SPEAK,
BUT HE CAN
STILL TELL
HIS TALE.
OUST FROM
A SKULL
YOu CAN FIND
THAT MUCH
INFORMATION
YEP. IT
HASTHE
SAME
SAIL
THIS SHIP
MUST HAVE
BEEN UP
THERE FOR
ABOUT 200
YEARS
BUT
THAT IS
A VERY
OLD
METHOD,
YES. IT WAS
USED TO CUIRE
SOME HEAD
DISEASES IN
THE PAST
THIS WAS
A CLISTOM OF
A PARTICULAR
AREA IN
SOUTH BLUE.
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
COVERED
WITH
RUBBER
OIL
IT'S
THE SAME
SHIP THAT
FELL FROM
THE SKY!
