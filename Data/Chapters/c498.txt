THAT..
. HE DOES
LIKE "SHABONDY

LET'S SEE...
I THINK HE
WOULD BE
SOMEWHERE IN
GROVE 1-29.
WHERE
SHOULD WE
START
LOOKING?
THAT'S A
PROBLEM..
THEN
I SUPPOSE WE
MUST SEARCH
FOR HIM.
HE'S PRETTY
NOTORIOUS
HIMSELF,
SO
HE'S BE GOING
WHEREVER THE
MARINES ARE.

THAT
MANY!?
MY SOURCES
TELL ME THAT.
WITH YOU GUYS
HERE NOW
LOOK,
WHEREVER
YOU GO... YOU
BETTER BE
CAREFUL.
THERE ARE 11
PIRATES ON
SHABONDY
ARCHIPELAGO
WITH BOUNTIES
OVER 100
MILLION!!SO, OF COURSE
THE PIRATES
WHO CHOSE ONE
OF THE OTHER
6 ROUTES,
WENT THROUGH
THE SAME KIND OF
DIFFICULTIES AS
YOU DID, AND
SOME OF THEM
MADE IT HERE.
ALL THE
WORLD'S
ROOKIES HAVE
GATHERED
HERE AT THE
SAME TIME.
THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS
EVERY DAY...
THERE'S
SOMEONE
HIGHER UP
THAN
LUFFY!?
YOU SHOULD AT
LEAST KNOW THE
NAMES OF YOUR
RIVALS, RIGHT?
UFUFUFu...
INFORMATION
IS A WEAPON.
ON THESE
ISLANDS!?
SPEAKING OF
BOUNTIES... AMONG
THE ROOKIES, YOU'RE
ONLY NUMBER 2!!
YEAH
WHEN YOU ALL
ENTERED THE "GRAND
LINE".
.. THERE WERE
7 DIFFERENT ROUTES
YOU COULD HAVE
TAKEN.
YOU PICKED ONE
ROUTE AND
FOLLOWED THAT
LOG TO THIS POINT.
FUU.
NO MATTER WHAT
ROUTE YOU TAKE,
YOU RUN INTO
THE "RED LINE".
AND SO.
EVERYONE
GATHERS HERE
TO CROSS THE
WALL.
GET IT?
THOSE NAMES
HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER THE
NEWSPAPERS.

THESE PIRATES
BEING AROUND
MAKES ME

EVEN BECOME THE
PERSON WHO
INSPIRES THE NEXT
GENERATION OF
PIRATES.
AT THE VERY LEAST,
ALL THESE ROOKIES
ENTERING THE NEW

DEFINITELY
ROOTING FOR
YOu GuYS,
MONKEY-CHAN!!
HE'S

ALREADY
THE THIRD

NYuu~, THE ARCHIPELAGO
IS PRETTY BIG, SO THERE
ARE PLACES WHERE THE

DOESN'T REACH.

DON'T GO TO
THE VERY
INLAND AT ALL.
WE'RE AT

KIND OF PLACE
AROUND, SO THE
WHERE A COATING

TOWN SEEM PRETTY
WOULD BE!!
SUSPICIOUS.
I WONDER WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE..
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THERE'S NOTHING
BUT BOUNTY
HUNTERS AROUND
THE FOOD
SAMPLING SHOP.
NO THE SOUVENIR
SHOP IS OUT OF
SIGHT...
er.netWAS TO HELP
MONKEY-CHAN AND
HIS CREW GET
THEIR SHIP COATED,
RIGHT?
THE REASON
WHY YOU AND
CAMIE-CHAN
CAME THIS WAY
BY LAND
THERE'S NO
WAY HE WOULD
HAVE LEFT THE
ARCHIPELAGO...
EHH!? THE GUY'S
NOT HERE!? BUT
WE WANT TO GO
TO THE FISHMAN
ISLAND!
WELL, HE'S
NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.
YOU SHOULD
LOOK FOR HIM
IN THE BARS
AND GAMBLING
HOLSES
AROUND HERE.
SO, I'M NOT
WORRIED
ABOUT HIS
HEALTH OR
ANYTHING.
HE'S PROBABLY
BEEN MEETING
WOMEN AND
SHACKING UP
HERE AND THERE,
SIX
MONTHS
!?
I GUESS PICKING
UP AND LEAVING
FOR LONG PERIODS
OF TIME IS JUST
WHAT FORMER
PIRATES DO.
THIS
CRAFTSMAN
GUY WAS A
PIRATE, TOO!?
OH, THERE'S
NO NEED TO
SAY IT, I
ALREADY GET
IT
BY THE
WAY,
SHAKKI.
NYuu~.
THAT'S
ABOUT IT.
IN OTHER
WORDS, you
WANT RAYLEIGH
TO DO THE
COATING FOR
YOu?
I SUPPOSE SO.
BUT HE HASN'T
BEEN BACK FOR
ABOUT SIX
MONTHS NOW.
IF WE WAIT
HERE, HE'LL
COME BACK,
WON'T HE?

R: HI ODA-SENSEI. THIS IS PRETTY FAST, BUT IN
VOLUME 50, CHAPTER 490, THERE WAS A "CIRCLE
RAINBOW." I THINK I SAW ONE IN THE SCHOOLYARD
ONCE, BUT WHAT MAKES THEM APPEAR? PLEASE
TEACH ME THEIR SPLENDOR. EHEHE.
-BORO ZATSUJI
O: THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING. "CIRCLE RAINBOWS" ARE VERY RARE, AND
THEY'RE ONLY MADE UNDER A LARGE NUMBER OF COINCIDENCES. ANYWAY,
I JUST KINDA DREW ONE IN A PANEL THERE, BUT THEY ACTUALLY DO
EXIST. OR, MORE CORRECTLY, ALL RAINBOWS ARE CIRCULAR.
Figurel A rainbone
Ascreen of
water droplets.
This ande
M
is 42
degrees!
* IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND,
BUT A RAINBOW IS MADE WHEN SUNLIGHT IS
REFLECTED OFF WATER DROPLETS. THE
The sun.
LIGHT IS REFLECTED LIKE A PRISM, BUT THE
SUN / WATER DROPLET / PERSON HAS TO BE
POSITIONED AS DEPICTED IN FIGURE 1, OR
ELSE THE RAINBOW ISN'T VISIBLE. THE LIGHT
IS ALWAYS BENT AT 42 DEGREES, SO WHEN
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE RAINBOW FROM
THE GROUND, THE BOTTOM HALF IS HIDDEN
Figure 2
BENEATH THE HORIZON. THE "CIRCLE RAINBOW"
FROM THE STORY WAS SEEN FROM THE SEA,
SO I THOUGHT THAT WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT IN
OUR WORLD, IT WOULD BE OKAY IN THE "GRAND
LINE." ONCE, ONE OF MY MANGAKA FRIENDS
SAID THAT HE SAW A CIRCLE RAINBOW FROM A
PLANE SO I KNEW ABOUT IT, BECAUSE PEOPLE
CAN GO INTO THE ATMOSPHERE NOW. MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN SEE IT FROM A
SCHOOL BUILDING. WAIT, DID THIS TURN INTO A SCIENCE TEXTBOOK!? WE'LL
NOW CONTINUE WITH THE SILLY MANGA "ONE PIECE." DON'T CHANGE THAT
