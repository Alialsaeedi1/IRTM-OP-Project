TREASURE MARK THAT

TO CAPTAIN JOHN'S
TREASURE
I SEE! YOU
GOT NICE
ALL OF A
SUDDEN.INTRODUCING
ONE PIECE WEB!!
Ponio
R: Hello, Oda. This is the first letter I've written. I always have fun reading.
Really. So, when you wrote in a SBS in volume 53 that you were going to slowly
bring One Piece to a close, I ran to get a pen. Please don't say anything like
that again. Don't say you're sorry for making us spend Money, please. I know
this is a BS, but I don't have any questions.
-Taba
O: What do you mean no question!! 3 But after I said that in voluMe 53, I got a
Mountain of postcards like this, so I was surprised. There's no deep Meaning
behind it! UM, first, when I was talking about an ideal length of publication, I was
thinking about the readers who have to buy all of the books. As an author, I
always want new readers, but people who started reading in the Middle, for
example, might not know that Luffy was the first Member of the Strawhat
Pirates. I want them to know what kind of adventures they had and the friends
they made along the way, but I can't just tell them to buy
More than 50 books, right!? Even I know that kids don't
have that kind of Moneu! To deal with this and let people
know the past story, we've Made several summary books.
But this time, my desire to make it as cheap as possible
has been granted by two companies, "Kyarameru Mama"
and "Hearty Way!" It's too Cheap!! Because it's free!! Nice
fight, guys!! They've made a site called One Piece Web! It
has a perfect story guide. It explains the entire past
story!! Kids who can't afford all of the books can just go to
this site! Access it! (Adults, you go buy the books, please.) So when I said that
before, it was because I was worried about this, so I apologize. It's not like I'M
losing my passion. I've only wanted to do one thing from the beginning, and that's
to tell lots of stories and Make an interesting manga until the end. In the big
picture, One Piece is roughly in its middle third. If you have time, please stay with
us. I'll always fight to Make a story unlike any you've read before. And check out
the site too!!
