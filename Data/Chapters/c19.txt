mangareader.netBUGGY, "THE CLOWN PIRATED
THE PROCESS OF GETTING ON
THE STAGE!!
Part 1
MY NOSE
IS WAY
TOO
BIG!
* ABOUT THE PICTURE ON PAGE 26 (OP018-20.JPG).
WHY IS IT [BUGGY*]? I BELIEVE A LOT OF READERS
WERE PUZZLED BY THAT. HOWEVER, THE PICTURE
WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I ORIGINALLY NAMED
THE CURRENT BUGGY PIRATE FLEET, WHICH MEANS
THAT BUGGY WAS INITIALLY GIVEN THE
NAME [BUGGY*]
*U SOUNDS AS IN "TOO" NOT AS IN "CUP"
* THEN WHY DID IT BECOME BUGGY INSTEAD?
WELL, ONE DAY, I WATCHED THIS MOVIE, AND IN THE
MOVIE, THERE WAS SOME GUY CALLED PUGGY. "HEY!
THAT'S THE SAME AS THE NAME I AM GOING TO USE!)
DAMN IT! I DON'T WANT THE NAME BUGGY]
ANYMORE!" SO I CHANGED THE NAME TO BUGGY.
* WHY IS BUGGY'S NOSE ROUND?
THAT'S TO GO ALONG WITH HIS IMAGE AS A CLWON.
* THEN WHO'S THE GUY ON THE LEFT MOST CORNER
OF THE PICTURE?
WHO IS IT? ACTUALLY AT THAT TIME, I HAVENT
THOUGHT OF THE NAMES OF THE THREE PEOPLE
BEHIND HIM. I WAS ONLY THINKING THEM AS:
A MUSCLEMAN, A BEAST TRAINER AND A WEIRD
SWORDSMAN. THAT TIME, WHILE THEY WERE STILL
FAR FROM BEING ON STAGE (IMPORTANT PART OF
THE STORY), SO THEY WERE STILL UNDEVELOPED.
mangareader.netHEu-
KAHCK!!!
MOST
LIKELY!
I'VE GOT TO
QUICKLY
STEAL THE
WAREHOUSE
TREASURE
AND RUN
AWAY!
