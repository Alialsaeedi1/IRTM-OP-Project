QUESTIONS
ANSWERS
D: HOW FAR CAN LUFFY'S ARMS STRETCH? PLEASE TELL ME.
O: HE CAN STRETCH THEM REALLY FAR. RIGHT NOW, LUFFY
CAN STRETCH ABOUT 72 GOMU GOMU. BUT LUFFY IS NOW
WORKING HARD, TRYING TO ACHIEVE I00 GOMU GOMU
RECORD.
D: HELLO! I PASSED MY HIGH SCHOOL ENTRY EXAM AND GOT
INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL I WANTED, ALL BECUASE OF ODA-
SENSE! THANK YOU SENSEl!
O: YES.
„HUH?!
D: HOW DID YOU NAME THE CHARACTERS?
O: NAMES... MOST OF THEM WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY
SOUNDED GOOD FOR THE CHARACTERS. ALSO, SOME OF
THEM ARE BASED ON REAL PIRATE NAMES.
D: HOW COME LUFFY NEVER KILLS HIS ENEMIES? THROUGH-
OUT "ONE PIECE" MANGA SO FAR, HE DIDN'T KILL MOHJI
AND HELMEPPO, BUT AXE-ARM MORGAN WAS KILLED BY
ZORO, WHY IS THAT?
O: HMM! THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. FIRST, I HAVE TO
ANNOUNCE THAT MORGAN IS STILL ALIVE. HE'S CUR-
RENTLY IN JAIL, WHERE HE WAS PLACED BY HIS FORMER-
SUBORDINATES.
WHY DOESN'T LUFFY KILL HIS ENEMIES? BECAUSE IN THAT
ERA, EVERYONE USES THEIR LIVES TO FIGHT FOR THEIR
DREAMS. FOR AN ENEMY, WHEN THEIR DREAM HAS BEEN
SHATTERED, IT IS THE SAME AS LOSING A FIGHT, AND AS
PAINFUL AS DEATH. I BELIEVE, FOR A PIRATE NOT TO KILL
AN ENEMY, IT'S GIVING THEM A 2ND CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR
THEIR DREAMS.
