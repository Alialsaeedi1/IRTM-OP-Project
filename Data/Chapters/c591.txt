WHAT IF HANCOCK
HAD FALLEN IN
LOVE WITH MONKEY-
CHAN, THOUGH...?
WOULDN'T THAT
MAKE EVERYTHING
ADD uP?
HOWEVER, MY
DEDUCTIONS STOPPED
THERE... I COULD NOT
IMAGINE THAT HANCOCK,
WHO SO HATES BOTH
THE GOVERNMENT
AND MEN...
WOULD EVER
HAVE BOARDED A
GOVERNMENT SHIP
WITH A MALE
COMPANION.
THERE IS
A LOT TO
LIKE ABOUT
HIM, YOU
KNOW!
SENDING HIM HERE. IT
WAS INVESTIGATING THIS
DIRECTION THAT DREW
MY ATTENTION TO
THE ISLE OF WOMEN.
?
I WAS
INFORMED OF
THE DIRECTION
IN WHICH LUFFY
HAD BEEN
PROPELLED.
PLEASE ALLOM
ME TO SPEAK
WITH YOU A
LITTLE...
I APOLOGISE
FOR ACTING
SUDDENLY AND
WITHOUT PROPER
EXPLANATION.
I FOUND THAT
HANCOCK'S ROUTE
TO THE BATTLE
COINCIDED WITH
LUFFY'S OWN.
AFTER COLLECTING
ALL THE INFORMATION
I COULD FIND ABOUT
THE GREAT BATTLE, AND
MAKING THE APPROPRIATE
CALCULATIONS.
mangareader.hetIF YOU MEAN TRAFALGAR
LAW, HE SET SAIL JUST
A SHORT WHILE AGO. HE
TOLD ME TO TELL YOLI TO
MAKE SURE YOU REST FOR

WERE THERE
NOT A GROUP OF
OTHER PIRATES
HERE?
YEAH.
THANKS.
HERE... THIS HAT
MEANS A LOT TO
YOU, YES?
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR LIFE

DANGER.
STILL, I WONDER
WHAT THE DARK KING'S UP
TO... THE "D" WILL ALWAYS
BRING A STORM WITHOUT
FAIL... HEHEH...
IT WOULD'VE BEEN
GREAT TO BE ABLE
TO ACTLIALLY GO
INSIDE.../ THE
LAND OF WOMEN.
AHH, IT'S SUCH A
SHAME... AFTER
GOING ALL
THAT WAY...

IF ONLY
THEY WERE 9.

...STILL, FRIEND
OF LUFFY THOUGH
YOU MAY BE...
.AS ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KEEPING LUFFY HIDDEN
FROM THE MARINES, IT
TROUBLES ME TO THINK THAT
ANYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO
DEDUCE HIS LOCATION SO
EASILY.
HAHAH... NO, I DOUBT THE
MARINES WILL HAVE
ANY IDEA THAT LUFFY-
KUN IS HERE.
COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE
RAYLEIGH?!!

D: Oda Sensei!! Hello!! Out of the blue, but please give my Axolot (unknown
gender) a name!! Please!! P.N.Gwaaaaaaaa Woaaaaaah
O: Oh a Whooper Looper, huh? It was popular back then. Those
cute Mexican salamanders. In general, people call them Axolot!
(pronounced "Ahoro-toru). How's this? "AhoAho Ahonosuke*
(DumbDumb Dumbbunny). Please be nice to it.
D: Hello Oda Sensel! Is it possible that in volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the
1lth page, I see the 3rd person(Sabol's cup? P.N. Saitouryu
O:Wow- again, looking at those teeny parts. The answer is easy,
if you read chapter 585 in this volume, you'll see the same
scene and you'll be able to tell it's Sabo's cup, but at the time
in chapter 558, Brothers", if I revealed Sabo, things would
get complicated, so I secretly drew it. Still, from back
then, there were many readers pointing out what is
this, and I seriously freaked out. What in the world are
you people!! You're correct!!
P: I was reading ONE PIECE and noticed all of the sudden, but other than character introducing and
SBS, you never copy and paste a picture you already drew, right? Is this a policy-type thing of yours?
From Snow Pea
O: So, you looked there. Well, yeah. I never copy and pasted before. Unhh, well we all receive
our papers from the publisher, and it pretty much goes like I page= money. Like, if you draw
on I page, they pay you. So if you paste a drawing from the past, isn't that kinda cheating?
(haha) Of course, I don't complain about other people. From my personality, I can't stand
pasting, plus if I draw everything, I feel pretty much secure that I'm drawing manga with my
full power. My personality. And I'm positive; in other words not perverted. Everyone.
