I HAVE A DREAM.
OH, I WANT TO SCRIBBLE A DOG.
"CAN I DRAW NOSE HAIR ON IT?"
"CAN I DRAW IT LIKE A PANDA?"
I'VE TRIED TO SCRIBBLE MY
FRIEND'S DOG BUT HE WON'T LET
ME.
HE TOLD ME TO GET MY OWN
DOG TO SCRIBBLE, BUT I DON'T
WANT THE WEIRD KIND OF DOG
LIKE HE HAS.

mangareader.netQUESTIONS
ANSWERS
AS ANNOUNCED IN BOOK 2, THE SBS CORNER (QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS CORNER) IS NOW CREATED. I RECEIVED A
LOT OF LETTERS, THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT SENT
THEM.
AND NOW, I (O = ODA = THE MANGAKA) WILL GIVE AN
ANSWER TO ALL OF YOU READER'S (D = DOKUSHA
READER) QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.
D: HOW OLD ARE LUFFY, ZORO, NAMI, AND SHANKS?
O: A LOT OF PEOPLE MAILED ME WITH QUESTIONS REGARD-
ING AGE. REALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE. I GUESS THIS MUST
BE THE NO. I QUESTION THAT EVERYONE ALWAYS THINKS
OF. WELL I WILL ANSWER IT NOW! LUFFY IS CURRENTLY 17
YEARS OLD, ZORO 19, NAMI 18. WELL, SINCE WE HAVE NO
IDEA WHERE SHANKS IS AT THIS MOMENT, ILL JUST
ANSWER HOW OLD HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I0 YEARS
AGO. WHEN HE WAS STILL IN LUFFY'S VILLAGE, HE WAS 27
YEARS OLD. AS FOR USOPP, HE'S 17 YEARS OLD JUST LIKE
LUFFY.
D: HOW COME ALL THE ENEMIES THAT LUFFY MEETS, ARE
ALL WEIRDOS?
O: EH... WEIRDOS..? NOW THAT YOU READERS MENTION IT,
FINALLY NOTICED THAT THEY TRULY ARE WEIRD. BUT,
GUESS IT'S BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WEIRD
MAKES THEM MORE MYSTERIOUS. AREN'T THEY MUCH
COOLER THIS WAY?
D: EIICHIRO ODA-SENSEI, CAN YOUR ARMS AND LEGS REALLY
STRETCH? THEY WROTE THAT ON "WEEKLY JUMP"
O: WAH! I THINK I WROTE THAT MYSELF... BUT THAT'S SUP-
POSED TO BE A SECRET.
