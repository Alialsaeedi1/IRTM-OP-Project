SO, BACK TO MY QUESTION. IN CHAPTER
372 OF VOL 39, SANJI USES "PARAGE
SHOT." IF YOU GET "PARAGED," EXACTLY
HOW BEAUTIFUL CAN YOU GET? TELL ME!
-34590
n.
WE'RE TALKING COMPLETE MAKEOVER HERE. JUST AS YOU SAW WITH WANZE,
YOU GET HOLLYWOOD-MOVIE-STAR-DROP-DEAD-GORGEOUS LOOKS. BUT IT
HAS TWO SMALL CATCHES. ONE, BECAUSE IT'S SANJI WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,
HE'D NEVER KICK A WOMAN. SECOND, ONLY YOUR FACE CHANGES. SO IF
YOUR BODY'S LIKE A POTATO, EVEN THOUGH YOU'D HAVE A PRETTY FACE, THE
IMBALANCE WOULD JUST CREEP PEOPLE OUT.
GOOD WORK, ODA-SAN! PLEASE HEAR ME OUT; THIS
QUESTION HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS!! USUALLY A
BOUND VOLUME CONTAINS ABOUT 9 CHAPTERS, BUT
ONE PIECE HAS ABOUT 10-11 SOMETIMES! WHY IS
THAT!? IT'S BEEN STRANGELY THICK AS OF LATE.
AND THE STORY'S BEEN HOT, TOO!
-JOHN
思麼
YOL'RE RIGHT. TO TALK SHOP, COMIC VOLUMES ARE USUALLY LIMITED TO
AROUND 184 PAGES. COMMONLY, 9 CHAPTERS FIT PERFECTLY, BUT IN MY CASE
"THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE 10 OR 11!" I SOMETIMES DEMAND IT (SELFISHLY).
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT'S SERVICE TO MY READERS, AND IT ALSO GOES
TO SHOW HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT THE STORY. IN THE PAST, AFTER GOING
FROM A 11-CHAPTER VOLUME TO A 9-CHAPTER ONE, READERS EXPRESSED
LOTS OF COMPLAINTS OVER HOW THE VOLUMES WERE GETTING THINNER... SO
THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON TOO (LALGHS).
