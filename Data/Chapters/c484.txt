"I'M... GOING TO BECOME THE PIRATE KING." -TAS, PRINCE OF DREAMLAND
HAVE FUN.
SHIPS THAT SAIL TODAY ARE ALL NICE AND NEAT, SO I THINK THIS ISN'T A
PROBLEM FOR THEM, BUT WHAT ABOUT ANCIENT PIRATE
SHIPS? I MEAN, WHERE WOULD THE CREW TAKE A CRAP?
DOES IT JUST GO RIGHT INTO THE OCEAN AND THEN TO
HEAVEN?
-"SORRY-FOR-BEING-SO-FRANK-PIGGYBANK"
GOOD QUESTION. SAILING SHIPS WOULD
HAVE A HOLE IN THE DECK, WHICH PRETTY
MUCH ACTS LIKE A REGULAR TOILET FROM
THERE BECAUSE THE HOLE WOULD
CONNECT STRAIGHT TO THE SEA. TODAY, THERE ARE FEW CLASSIC SAILING SHIPS
LEFT FROM THAT LONG AGO, BUT EVEN THEY'VE GOT FLUSHING TOILETS NOW! YOU
KNOW, LIKE THE ONES ON THE AIRPLANES THAT GO "PFTGH" AND EJECT THE
CONTENTS REALLY HARD. YOU CAN THINK OF THE SUNNY AS HAVING THAT KIND OF
TOILET. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MEN, TOILET OR NO, THEY CAN TAKE A PISS FROM
PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE.
THIS IS THE FIRST LETTER I'VE EVER MAILED. IN
VOL 49, CH 475, "THE PIRATES IN THE FOREST,"
PAGE 107, THIRD PANEL, THERE WERE THESE TWO
GUYS CALLED THE "RISKY BROTHERS," RIGHT?
WELL, IN VOLUME 47, CHAPTER 451, WEREN'T
THERE TWO ZOMBIES ALSO CALLED THE "RISKY
BROTHERS" THAT LED NAMI AND THE REST TO
MORIA'S CASTLE?
-YOSHIKI
RIGHT, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THOSE
ADORABLE LITTLE SQUIRRELS WERE BEING
ANIMATED BY THE SHADOWS OF TWO CREEPY MEN.
IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. -TIME FOR A DIVORCE
SURE. BUT THE SBS ISN'T OVER YET!!
