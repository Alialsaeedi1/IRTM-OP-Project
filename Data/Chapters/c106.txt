WE CAN DOCK
INLAND
THERE'S A
RIVER RIGHT
UP AHEAD.
WHY?
DON'T FORGET THAT WE
HAVE TO STAY ON THIS
ISLAND FOR A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF TIME.
WAIT
JUST A
SECOND
AND THE
RECORDING
TIME VARIES
FOR EACH
ISLAND,
THERE'RE SOME
ISLANDS THAT TAKE
ONLY A FEW HOURS
TO RECORD, WHILE
SOME TAKE EVEN
A FEW DAYS.
FORGET
ABOUT'EM!
PREPARE
TO LAND!
JUST WHAT
IS UP WITH
THOSE TWO..
THEY'RE
GONE.
WELL,
WE CAN
ALWAYS
RUN AWAY
IF THAT'S
THE CASE
CONSIDERING
THIS PLACE IS
GRAND LINE
AND ALL, I'D
SAY THERE
IS A GOOD
POSSIBILITY.
