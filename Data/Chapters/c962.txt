TELL
YOUR

WE ARE HERE

HE
MUST BE

REALLY.
BUT
ODEN USED
HIS OVER-

IT WAS A

FILLED WITH

ALTHOUGH, IF
THEY ARE NOT
STRONG ENOUGH
TO SURVIVE IN KURI,

ONLY DELAYING
THEIR DEATH
SENTENCE.
KURI
HAS BECOME A
HAVEN FOR FLEEING
CRIMINALS. AS SOON
AS ONE CROSSES INTO
KURI, THE LAWS OF
THE SHOGUNATE ARE
MEANINGLESS.
KURI IS
SO LAWLESS,
IT MIGHT AS
