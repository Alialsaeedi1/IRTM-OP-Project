95質問
D: ARE THOSE THREE-ROPED THINGS OF HAIR COMING OUT OF ZEFF'S NOSE
A MUSTACHE? OR IT IS NOSE HAIR? OR FAKE HAIR?
O: IT'S BRAIDED HAIR. THE TECHNICAL NAME IS "SOMEHOW OKAY HAIR."
(NOTE: ODA'S ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A PUN. HE SAYS "YOSAGE,"
WHICH COLILD MEAN "OKAY HAIR," INSTEAD OF "OSAGE," OR "BRAIDED HAIR.")
D: ODA-SENSEI! I'M AKINORI! I THOUGHT OF A GREAT MOVE!
1. LUFFY STRETCHES OUT HIS ARM.
2. ZORO CUTS HIS ARM OFF.
3. THE ARM SHOOTS AWAY.
NOTE: THIS MOVE CAN ONLY BE USED TWICE!
O: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA..
D:
TO ODACCHI: I AM YOUR BETROTHED. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO BE
MARRIED? SHOULD IT BE NOVEMBER 15T? WE'RE GOING TO KISS IN THE
MARRIAGE CEREMONY, RIGHT?! I'M S00000 NERVOUS *KISS*!
ACTUALLY, I'M NAME AMURO'S LITTLE SISTER.
O: OKAY... TO THE HOSPITAL.
D: I WANNA SAY SOMETHING TO THE GLY WHO SAID ZORO'S STOMACH
BAND WAS FOR "OLD FOGIES" IN THE SBS ON P.130 OF VOLUME 4!! YOU,
YES, YOU!! FIRST, I TOO WONDERED, WHY DOES COOL GUY ZORO HAVE
STOMACH BAND? BUT THEN, ONCE I REALIZED THAT IT'S A PART OF
ZORO, IT BECAME OKAY! I, YES I SHALL ALLOW IT! SO YOU SHOULD
TOO! NOW WE'RE FRIENDS!
O:
...OH! A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN READERS HAS BLOOMED... WONDERFUL.
D: ONLY THE UPPER HALF OF BUGGY'S BODY CAN FLY AROUND (OR FLOAT,
OR WHATEVER), RIGHT? SO HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEND ONLY HIS TOP
HALF TO THE GRAND LINE THROUGH THE AIR. WHY DOESN'T HE DO THAT?
O:
HE CANNOT. A BARA-BARAMAN HAS A CERTAIN DISTANCE LIMIT TO HIS
ABILITY. THERE IS A 200 BARA BARA DIAMETER CIRCLE AROUND THE
POINT WHERE THE PERSON TOUCHES THE GROUND. OUTSIDE OF THAT
DISTANCE, HE CANNOT CONTROL THOSE PARTS OF HIS BODY.
