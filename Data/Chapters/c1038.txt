CHAPTER NOTES:
The Kojiki
THE KOJIKI
Yamato's move is a reference
to an ancient poem from the Kojiki.
Mahoroba is described as a blissful,
distant utopia somewhere in Yamato.
(Yamato being the ancient name for Japan)
The Kanji used, translates to
Horse Phantasm Blade.
Sugawara no Michizane
Big Mom's attack "Tenman-Tenjin" references Sugawara
no Michizane (picture on the left). Michazane was a
scholar, poet, and politician of the Heian Period.
He died in exile from his political rivals.
However, after his death plague and drought spread,
the sons of the Emperor died, and the capital was hit
with weeks of storms. Most notably the Imperial Palace's
Great Audience Hall was struck by lightning.
This was chalked up to Michazane's angry spirit and he
was posthumously pardoned.
Tenman-gu shrine
A shrine was subsequently built to appease and deify him.
He became known as Tenman-Tenjin, which is usually
shortened to Tenjin (meaning sky god).
Eventually he became more associated with peace and
scholarship than with storms and the sky.
The Shinto shrines dedicated to him are called Tenman-gü
(picture on the left). There are around 14,000 of them
in Japan. The attack also includes tR# - Daijizai,
which is a Buddhist expression that roughly translates to
"total freedom."
Corna Dio hand gesture
The final attack in the chapter references "Corna Dio."
which is the name for the bull horns hand gesture
associated with punk music.GREIISH
