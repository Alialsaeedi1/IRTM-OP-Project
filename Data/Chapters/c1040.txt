BOSSlCHAPTER NOTES:
DOES THIS
COUNTRY HOLD
SOME OF THE
ANSWERS?!
TCH, IT'S 50
FRUSTRATING!!
In Japanese, the subject is debatable in Big Mom's line about
Wano holding something. At a glance, it is easy to presume
that it's still the same as from the previous sentence,
but we feel that "answers" is more appropriate given
the context of the speech as a whole since it maintains
ambiguity and fits the intent best.
Assuming otherwise gives the impression that Wano holds part
of the treasure. This impression isn't evident in the Japanese,
so the wording we settled on leaves that option open while also
accurately conveying the intended meaning of her monologue.
Her core frustration with Roger is over the lack of information
he left behind. Her dialogue suggests that Wano might hold the
key to some of these mysteries. Making sure that nuance
comes across was our top priority.
