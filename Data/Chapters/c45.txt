DID YOL GUYS KNOW THAT IF YOU
EAT SQUID INK SPAGHETTI, YOUR
POOP
COMES OUT BLACK
AS
WELL? COMPLETELY BLACK. THEN
PERHAPS IF I EAT RAINBOW CO-
LOURED SPAGHETTI, I MAY BE
ABLE TO
HAVE
RAINBOW
CO-
LOURED POOP? JUST MAYBE.
BUT
MAYBE IT DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER..

mandareade.netOH THAT WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT.
IT WAS JUST A
CANNONBALL THAT
WENT ASTRAY FROM
MY SELF-DEFENCE.
SO WHY'D YOU
TRY TO FIRE A
CANNONBALL AT
THIS RESTAURANT?
YOU'RE
A PIRATE?
WHAT'S
THAT
SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?
OH, THAT
OLD MAN USED
TO BE A PIRATE?
IN ANY CASE,
YOU'D BETTER NOT
TRY ANYTHING FUNNY
TO THIS RESTALIRANT
THIS
RESTAURANT'S
LIKE A TREASURE
TO THAT DAMN
GEEZER.
THE OWNER
OF THIS PLACE
USED TO BE THE
COOK OF A PRETTY
INFAMOUS PIRATE
CREW.
BUT IT'S QUITE
APPROPRIATE
CONSIDERING
ALL THE PIRATES
THAT FREQUENT
AROUND THESE
PARTS.
AND THE REST OF
THE COOKS WHO
CAME TO WORK
HERE OUT OF THEIR
ADMIRATION FOR
THAT GEEZER ARE
ALL HOT-BLOODED
AND CRUDE ENOUGH
TO BE PIRATES.

DO YOU HAPPEN TO
KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT GRAND LINE?
WHAT'S
KRIEG?
OH.
GIVE UP,
BESIDES, THE
GRAND LINE IS
JUST ONE PART OF
ALL THE OCEANS
IN THIS WORLD.
YOU'RE
STILL YOUNG.
NO NEED TO
RECKLESSLY
RUSH INTO
THINGS.
IF YOU WANT
TO BE A PIRATE,
THERE'S PLENTY
OF OTHER SEAS
FOR YOU TO ROAM
OUT THERE.
FOR A MEMBER
OF THE KRIEG
PIRATES, YOU SURE
ARE ACTING LIKE A
BIG SCAREDY CAT.
THAT'S
WHY IT'S SO
TERRIFYING...!
NO.

I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING…

D: ODA-SENSEl! ONE... TWO... JANGO!!!
O: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ... AH!! GOOD MORNING!!
D:
A WHILE AGO, A KID FROM AROUND HERE ASKED ME, "WHERE CAN I GO
TO MEET LUFFY?" WHERE CAN I GO TO MEET LUFFY? THE NORTH SEA?
THE SEA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH? THE TONE RIVER? LAKE BIWA?
O:
HMMMM.
• IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE TO GO IN ORDER TO MEET HIM. I
SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST SET OFF AN A RELAXING VOYAGE YOU MIGHT FIND
HIM. BUT BUGGY AND THE OTHERS ARE OUT THERE TOO, SO PLEASE BE
CAREFUL. PLEASE.
D: HMMMM, ABOUT "1, 2, JANGO": WHAT'S THAT STRIPED THING ON HIS
CHIN?
O: A MUSHROOM. BEFORE HE EVER BECAME A PIRATE, HE WAS A "WANDER-
ING DANCER". BUT BUSINESS WASN'T SO GOOD, SO ALL HE DID WAS
SLEEP. WITHOUT EVEN TAKING A BATH. AND EVENTUALLY A STRIPED
MUSHROOM GREW FROM HIS CHIN. SINCE HE WAS HUNGRY, HE TRIED
EATING THE CAP OF THE MUSHROOM, BUT IT WAS DISGUSTING! BUT HE
GULPED IT DOWN ANYWAYS, AND SOMEHOW BECAME ABLE TO HYPNOTIZE
PEOPLE. THEREFORE, THE STRIPED THING ON HIS CHIN IS A "LEFTOVER
MUSHROOM".
PHEWW.
