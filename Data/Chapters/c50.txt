mangareader.net曾問
汁
D: WERE THERE REALLY WOMAN PIRATES?
O: YES, THERE WERE. BUT IT WAS CONSIDERED BAD LUCK TO BRING A
WOMAN ON BOARD A SHIP IN THOSE DAYS, AND SO MANY OF THEM
DISGUISED THEMSELVES AS MEN. THERE WERE TWO WOMAN PIRATES,
MARY READ AND ANN BONNY, WHO WERE SAID TO HAVE FOUGHT MORE
BRAVELY THAN ANY MAN. BY THE WAY, MY CHARACTER ALVIDA WAS BASED
ON A FEMALE PIRATE NAMED ALVIDA WHO FORMED A PIRATE CREW
COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF WOMEN.
D: IN AN OLDER MANGA CALLED "ONI GA KITARITE" (BY SHINGAGIN-SENSEL)
THE SECOND PANEL ON P.16 OF THE FIRST VOLUME COULD ONLY HAVE
BEEN DRAWN BY YOU, ODA-SENSEI. WERE YOU AN ASSISTANT THERE?
O: I CAN'T ENDURE ANY MORE OF THESE LETTERS, SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND
CLEAR UP THIS MATTER ALL AT ONCE. HIROYUKI TAKEI, SHINGAGIN, MIKIO
ITO AND I WERE ALL ASSISTANTS FOR "RUROUNI KENSHIN." SO WHEN MY
FRIEND "GAGIN" GOT HIS OWN SERIES, I GAVE HIM A BIT OF HELP. ALSO
WORTH MENTIONING IS SHINYA SUZUKI, WHO JUST HAD HIS DEBUT
PUBLISHED, AND WAS AN ASSISTANT FOR RUROUNI KENSHIN, AS WELL AS
AN OCCASIONAL HELPER WITH ONE PIECE. AND THAT'S THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN ALL OF US. OK?
D: WHEN I WENT TO THE BARBER A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND ASKED FOR A
ZORO HAIRCUT, HE SHAVED MY HEAD. WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO GET A
HAIRCUT LIKE ZORO'S?
O: ASK FOR THE CUT OF A "MAN'S HEART AND SPIRIT."
D:
IN CHAPTER 37, IS THE MAN WHO CAPTURED THE FAKE CAPTAIN KURO, THE
MARINE CAPTAIN "AXE-ARM MORGAN"? WHEN I ASKED MY FRIEND, HE
THOUGHT THEY LOOKED THE SAME TOO.
•:
HE'S MORGAN. HE WAS A SERGEANT AT THE TIME, AND THEN GOT
PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER. FROM THERE HE STRONG-ARMED
HIS WAY UP TO A CAPTAIN, AND WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF A MARINE BASE.
WHEN KURO LOOKED IN HIS EYES, HE MUST HAVE SENSED SOME SORT OF
KINDRED SPIRIT BETWEEN THEM.
