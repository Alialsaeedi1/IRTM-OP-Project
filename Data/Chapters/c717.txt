WELL, IT'S
NORMAL THAT
CRIMINALS
WOULD BE
ARRESTED.
THEY
PROBABLY
WANT TO
ARREST THEM
WHEN THEY
GET OUT.
IT SEEMS THAT
PIRATES AND CRIMINALS
CAN NORMALLY ATTEND
THIS TOURNAMENT.
DON'T FORGET
THAT YOU CAME
HERE ON A
PIRATE SHIP
TOO!!
YEAH, STILL
NO ONE..
.BUT THE
FIGHTERS'
ENTRANCES ARE
COMPLETELY
LOCKED...!!
I WISH I COULD
TELL LUFFY
ABOUT THIS.
