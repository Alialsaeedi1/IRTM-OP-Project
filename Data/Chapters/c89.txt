D: WHEN I READ YOUR MANGA, SENSE, I GET THE FEELING THAT
SHOULD DO WHAT I WANT. SO I'VE GOTTEN THE URGE TO PURSUE
MY DREAM TO BUILD A GIGANTIC BRIDGE IN AMERICA.
O:
THAT'S NICE. A BOY WITH A DREAM. I LIKE THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT? IF ANYONE TRIES TO STOP YOU, I'LL, LIKE... PUT ON A PAIR OF
LEATHER BOOTS... AND KICK THEIR LITTLE TOES OR SOMETHING. SO
DON'T WORRY. TRY HARD.
D:
BAM! BAM! CLICK. HELLOOOO? ODA-SENSEI...? ODAMN, HE'S NOT
HOME!!
O: THAT WAS TERRIBLE.
D:
WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN THE COOK PATTY SAYS, "EXCUSE ME,
YOUR HICKNESS"?
O:
YOU KNOW THE SAYING, "PLEASE EXCUSE ME, SIR"? WELL, HE SEEMS TO
BE USING "HICKNESS" IN THE PLACE OF "SIR." FOR EXAMPLE, YOU
WOULD USE IT LIKE THIS. "OH MY, YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A
YEAR? THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFUL, YOUR HICKNESS." "THIS MAN
HAS ACCOMPLISHED MANY GREAT DEEDS. A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR
HIS HICKNESS." AND SO ON...
D:
I HAVE A QUESTION. DOES USOPP HAVE BONES IN HIS NOSE?
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT BENT MANY TIMES NOW
O:
WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT. HOW COULD HIS NOSE POSSIBLY BEND?
WHAT A RIDICULOUS THING TO...
WHOA!! IT DOES BEND!!!
THE SBS IS OVER!!
