The Galley-La Company members interrupt the fight between Franky and Luffy at the shipyard, much to the annoyance of Franky. Paulie angrily confronts Luffy about his appearance at the shipyard. Franky concludes that not only did the Straw Hat Pirates messed with his family, but also the Galley-La Company too. Luffy however claims he and his crew did not do anything. Paulie, who believes he is lying, attacks Luffy and throws him into a pile of wood. As Franky angrily objects to the Galley-Las interruption, the other members prepare to attack much to the delight of the spectating crowd and surprise to the distressed Nami. As Luffy gets back onto his feet, the other members begin to attack. An angered Franky begins to attack both Luffy and the Galley-La. Kaku and Tilestone take care of him while Rob Lucci attacks Luffy, who is not returning attacks. After being sent crashing into the surrounding material, Luffy declares that they give him a reason to why they are attacking him. However, Paulie declares it should be Luffy who should explain why the Straw Hat Pirates shot Iceburg, much to the surprise of the spectators, Franky, Nami, and Luffy himself. Paulie continues to reveal that Iceburg remembered that there were two attackers, one being Nico Robin, shocking both Luffy and Nami. Franky asks if Iceburg is dead and Paulie replies that it is because he is alive that he wishes to finish off Luffy. Luffy states that Robin could not be involved and that Iceburg must be mistaken. He asks to go see Iceburg but is denied. The crowd, angry for the attack on the hero of Water 7, begin to attack Nami, realizing she too is part of Luffys crew. Paulie explains that its useless as the news will spread throughout Water 7. As an announcement stating the Straw Hats were the culprits, Robin is seen sitting reading a newspaper.
