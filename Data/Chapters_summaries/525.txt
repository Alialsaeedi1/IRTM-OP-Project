This chapter opens with Garp talking with Ace. They talk how Garp wanted Ace and Luffy to have become Marines like he had wanted. Ace then points out that they each have blood of a global-scale criminal and they could never be Marines. However Ace also mentions that he took his name "Portgas" from his mother that he says to have a great debt to, and that he does not care about his "useless" father. He then says that is the reason he joined Whitebeard and that he thinks of Whitebeard as his only father. Then on the Marine ship that Luffy and Hancock are on, the Marines see Buggy the Clowns ship, and say that it is unimportant because they do not remember their flag. While on Buggys ship Alvida talks with the crew and tells them that them sailing all the way there and buy an Eternal Pose was useless because their ship cannot get past the Calm Belt and the only other way is through the Gates of Justice where only marines can get in. The crew agrees to abandon Buggy. It then shows the many horrors of Impel Down. Such as a shadow of a beast with a club and horns that kills several prisoners and takes away their bodies. Then the Marine ship that Hancock is on arrives at Impel Down. Luffy looks out and sees that there are more ships here then when there were during the Buster Call. Hancock then tells Luffy to hide under her robes. Later Hancock is told that she will have to wear Seastone handcuffs and submit to a full body check this makes Hancock worry because they would find Luffy.
