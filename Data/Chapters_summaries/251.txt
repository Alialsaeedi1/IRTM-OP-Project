In the Shandia village, Aisa informs Wyper that she felt, using her Mantra, that two voices have been silenced in the forest. Wyper rejoices and realizes that this is the time for them to act and begin their assault. When Wyper leaves, Aisa reveals to Raki that it wasnt Gan Fall who defeated the priest, but some other very powerful people, who are also in the forest. Raki asks for the girls purse and when she refuses to give it away, claiming that her treasure is inside, Raki promises to bring more for her. In the forest, Usopp urges Luffy and Sanji to hurry up, if they want to catch up with their boat. Using Usopps waist rope, they finally manage to get on board. Nami seems to have discovered something about Upper Yard, and is about to lead Zoro and Robin there to make sure. While the rest of the priests, using Mantra, acknowledge the defeat of their comrade in the hands of the newcomers, the Shandia warriors have begun their invasion in Gods island, led by Wyper who is determined to light the fire of Shandia. Chopper wakes up back on the Altar and, seeing Gan Fall and Pierre unconscious around him, wonders who saved them from drowning. Namis group reach a clearing where they see something familiar. A missing part of a house they saw down on Jaya. This leads them to realize that, Upper Yard was once on the ground, originally a part of the island of Jaya.
