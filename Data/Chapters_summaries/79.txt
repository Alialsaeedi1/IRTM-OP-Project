After Bell-mères death, Nami was kidnapped when Arlong discovered her ability for drawing maps. All the villagers decided to fight to take her back, but she suddenly came back by herself, revealing that she was now part of Arlongs crew. She even showed that she could earn all the money she wanted. Disgusted by this selfish behavior, the villagers rejected her. But when Nojiko went to her mothers grave, Nami was already sitting there. She explained to her sister that in order to accomplish their mothers last wish and live, they could not rebel against Arlong who was too strong for them. Instead she decided to draw maps for him, revealing that she would be able to buy her village back for 100,000,000.
