Members of the royal army are surprised that Princess Vivi requested to destroy the palace, that has a 4,000 year old history. Chaka, hesitating at first, ordered everyone to follow the princesss every demand, bowing down to Vivi. Back at the South Block, Mr. 2, possessing Namis face, presses down on a beaten and grounded Sanji, telling him hes not as strong as he says he is. Sanji comments to himself that even though he looks different, hes still an okama on the inside, and tells Mr. 2 not to get cocky, but becomes infatuated again when he looks at Namis face. Mr. 2 proceeds to take off his clothes, saying this country is too hot, prompting Sanji to ask if he ("she") needs help, but he is knocked back by Mr. 2s Okama Kenpo. Every time Sanji prepares to attack, Mr. 2 changes his face back to Namis to prevent him. After attacking Sanji with his Mascara Boomerang, Mr. 2 prepares to finish Sanji off, only for Sanji to notice he has his original face and kicks him away. Sanji points out the weakness of Mr. 2s Mane Mane no Mi powers, explaining that he cannot use Okama Kempo while impersonating Nami, and he changes back to normal by touching his face with his left hand. Mr. 2, dismissing this, attacks Sanji with his Prima attack, which Sanji barely dodges, but not before noticing the attack left a clean hole in a buildings wall. Sanji, deducing a weakness of the attack, dodges and proceeds to counterattack, prompting Mr. 2 to change into Nami again. Sanji tells Mr. 2 that there is something on his left cheek, prompting Mr. 2 to touch his face with his left hand, changing him back to normal. Sanji then uses Veau Shot on him.
