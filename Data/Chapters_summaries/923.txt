Kaidous dragon form slams into the ground after being hit in the head by Luffy. As his subordinates flee the area, they take note that a samurai appeared to have been the one behind the attack. Reaching the ground, Luffy yells to his crew and asks if they managed to escape Kaidous dragon breath attack. Elsewhere, Shutenmaru decides to stay and watch the fight instead of fleeing. Luffy hears several of Kaidous subordinates discover Lady Speed who is heavily injured. Fearing for Tamas life, Luffy asks Lady Speed if she was able to get Tama out of the city safely; he learns that Kaidou spotted them and despite doing her best to protect Tama, Kaidou injured them both. Angered by this, Luffy chastises himself for not going along with them and prepares to attack Kaidou. Law frantically tells Luffy they need to check on their respective crews and berates him for jeopardizing their plans; Luffy ignores Law and yells at Kaidou, getting his attention. Despite still in a drunken state, Kaidou recognizes Luffy and comments how hes finally arrived in Wano. He then unleashes another blast of fire towards Luffy, incinerating the immediate area; however, Lady Speed is able to propel Luffy into the air towards Kaidous eye level. Luffy immediately activates Gear 3 and pummels Kaidou with numerous punches. The remaining Beast Pirates are shocked to see Kaidou taking such a tremendous beating and he falls from the sky, transforming back into his human form. Luffy rushes forward, activates Gear 4 and resumes his attack. However, Kaidou gets back on his feet to the surprise of everyone. Glaring at Luffy, Kaidou swings his kanab≈ç and strikes Luffy, seeming to dash forward, mocking his proclamation of becoming the Pirate King as Luffy soars through the air and is knocked unconscious from the blow.
