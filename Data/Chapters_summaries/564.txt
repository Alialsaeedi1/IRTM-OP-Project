As Whitebeard charges into battle, all of his crew and allies follow behind and open a path for him. One of the Decalvan Brothers comments on how hard it must be for Squard to have been tricked and to be responsible for stabbing Whitebeard, causing Whitebeards allies to scream that theyll never forgive the Marines. As Squard wallows in grief of his own sins, Marco asks him if just crying will help set things right and that he should go and repay his debt. Luffy, musing on how strong Whitebeard must be, continues to run head-long towards the execution platform. Ivankov notes that all of the Marines are retreating into the plaza. While Jinbe agrees that it is worrisome, he states that theres no time to think, as Whitebeard is on the move. John Giant then appears on the front line, ready to stop Whitebeard and his crew as his and Whitebeards weapons. Whitebeard then surprises the giant by causing an earthquake so massive, that the entire island tilts to one side. As the Marines panic, Doflamingo laughs about how insane Whitebeard is, while Hancock continues to care only for Luffys safety. Whitebeard then delivers a quake-imbued punch to John Giants chest, defeating him. As onlookers wonder why the quakes arent effecting the execution platform, they see that the three admirals are somehow holding it together, as the three banter about how its each others fault that the wall is not up yet. As the pirates finally make it towards the city, dozens of walls shoot up from the ground, blocking their path. As much as the pirates try to attack it, the wall will not budge. Cannons emerge from the walls, preparing to fire. However, one wall near the front remains open; Oars body is blocking the walls path, and his blood has interfered with the system. Although the situation is not ideal, Sengoku commands Akainu to attack anyway; Akainu then uses RyÅ«sei Kazan, causing a storm of flaming fists to rain down upon the pirates.
