As the battle between Gan Fall and Shura continues, elsewhere, a little girl is shown walking amongst the clouds, when she finally arrives in a village hidden inside the clouds, the village of Shandia. The girl, named Aisa, meets a Shandia warrior there, who warns her that, if she keeps going to Upper Yard, she will end up dead. Meanwhile, the rest of the warriors discuss about Gan Falls skirmish in Upper Yard, whom, along with Enel, they consider an enemy and hope they take each other out. The masked attacker is revealed to be Wyper, the descendant of the great Shandia warrior, Kalgara. Zoro, Nami and Robin wonder in the forest, until Robin finds some kind of ruins that pick her interest. Ahead of them lies a river, which they have to cross, if they wish to enter deeper into the forest. Nami watches over the distance with her binoculars and spots the area called Upper Yard. Back at the altar, Chopper is amazed by the speed in which the two opponents clash. Suddenly, Gan Fall finds it hard to move his body, which got trapped in Shuras ordeal of strings. Unable to move, the dethroned God suffers a fatal wound by the priests lance, and with his last words, asks Chopper to defeat Enel and his priests, for the sake of all those who have fallen. At the same time, Pagaya suggest that, he and Conis create something to help the Straw Hat Pirates.
