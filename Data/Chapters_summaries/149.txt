Chopper is determined to defend the honor of the pirate flag. To defeat Chessmarimo, he uses a Rumble Ball, a drug which will increase his power for 3 minutes. Chessmarimo mocks Chopper as he watches the reindeers 3 Zoans transformations. He laughs that none of the modes are enough to defeat him. However, he is surprised when Chopper is able to avoid is attacks, thanks to two additional transformations. Chopper informs him that the Rumble Ball allows him to have four supplementary combinations beside the standard three, making a total of seven transformations.

He quickly discovers that Chessmarimos chin is his weak point and delivers a powerful kick in the chin and knocks him out. However, during the fight, distracted by the reindeers demonstration, Luffy did not notice that Wapol had escaped.
