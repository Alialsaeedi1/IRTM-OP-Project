With Mozu and Kiwi struggling to keep up with the wind, Franky roams Water 7 in search for Luffy. The other members catch up with them and inform them that they saw Usopp, who they still believe to be a member of the Straw Hats, alone on the Going Merry. In an attempt to lure out Luffy, Franky decides to kidnap Usopp as bait. At the Galley-La Headquarters, the four remaining Straw Hats continue to keep watch. Inside, Iceburg requests Kalifa to leave and to send in Paulie. Complying with his wishes, she leaves the area after sending in Paulie while the other four leave their seats as not to overhear. Iceburg is seen giving details of a task which Paulie accepts without question. As he leaves the room, he gives his excuses and leaves the remaining four to keep watch. He is next seen in the Presidents Room finding a safe and entering a combination which Iceburg gave him. Nico Robin along with the bear-masked man are seen standing on a rooftop answering a Den Den Mushi saying they are both ready. An explosion suddenly goes off at the Galley-La Headquarters alerting everyone around the area and starting a panic causing Tilestone and Peepley Lulu to leave their post. A musketeer-styled assailant is seen being chased around using a spiked whip to escape to a higher floor where they are confronted by more Galley-La workers. Robin and the bear-masked man are also being chased around the area. The Straw Hats, who were busy observing the chaos, realize that Luffy has disappeared. Back in the Presidents Room, Paulie has found a pile of papers in the safe just as two other masked men appear.
