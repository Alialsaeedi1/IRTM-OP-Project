Vivi begins to appreciate life on board the Going Merry and the carefree lifestyle of her new friends. She has reservations as she constantly warns them to not underestimate the dangers that await them on the Grand Line. After a calm journey, they finally arrive at Little Garden island which Miss All Sunday warned them about. It appears to be made of a weird tropical forest and is inhabited by even stranger animals. Nami is not eager to leave the boat as their log pose resets but the rest of the crew has an opposing opinion. Luffy craves adventure and decides to set out to explore. Much to Namis surprise, Vivi decides to accompany Luffy in order to be distracted from her worries. She drags along a not-so-willing Karoo. After they depart, Sanji asks Zoro to go on a hunt in order to retrieve more food as they are running low. Zoro, who is not so pleased to work on Sanjis orders, replies with a nasty comment that hed get something bigger than Sanji anyways. Sanji refuses to lose face in front of Nami and challenges Zoro to a hunt contestâ€”to see who can bring back the largest weight in food for the crew. Luffy and Vivi discover weird animals and they realize Little Garden is, in fact, a prehistoric island which has stayed evolutionary-wise at the dinosaur era. Meanwhile back at the boat, Nami and Usopp are alone and not confident aboard the Going Merry. Nami finds a book which explains the islands name. Suddenly a giant shadow approaches them.
