The crew of Masira call out for their captain. Meanwhile Nami, Chopper and Usopp try to convinces themselves everything that is happening is just a dream. Robin interrupts the moment to point out Luffy, Sanji and Zoro were eaten by the giant turtle. Nami is accused of sending them to their death, but Namis "sorry" is anything but sincere. Robin notes that the ropes leading to Sanji, Luffy and Zoro are attached to the mouth of the turtle and that if they do not cut them now, theyll be pulled under when it dives. While Masiras crew pull on the ropes and make attempts to rescue their captain, Nami orders the others to cut the ropes so they can get to safety. Suddenly, all goes dark and Luffy falls unconscious and carrying a bag. Soon, Zoro and Sanji appear also carrying a bag. As the crew go to leave, Masira appears and angrily claims they cannot just enter his territory, steal his treasure and leave. Nami hears the word treasure and just as Masira is about to start fighting the Straw Hats, his attention is drawn away by his crew. Everyone (including the giant turtle) stops in fear at what they are seeing across the sky. Giant shadowy figures cast themselves over the sky land, appearing as monsters. The Straw Hats make a sharp getaway as fast as the Going Merry can take them. The crew recollect the events of the day and how strange theyve been and suddenly become aware Masira is on the ship, and Luffy, Zoro and Sanji quickly kick him overboard.
