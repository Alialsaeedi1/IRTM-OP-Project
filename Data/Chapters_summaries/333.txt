The Straw Hat Pirates look on as Usopp and Luffy continue their duel in the smoke covered area. The pair attack at the same time, but Usopp reverses Luffys attack with an Impact Dial. An exhausted Usopp is shocked to see that Luffy is still standing and the pair stare at each other while remembering making the Straw Hat Pirates flag. Luffy finally hits Usopp with a final attack causing him to collapse to the ground completely defeated. As the others watch in pain, Luffy walks towards the ship telling a defeated Usopp that the Going Merry is his as they will get a new ship. He bids farewell to him while remembering the good times that they have had together. Chopper, devastated by the events, attempts to check Usopps wounds but he is stopped by Sanji who explains how painful it must feel for already being pitied. As they leave the ship, all except for Zoro and Sanji are in tears as they say goodbye to both Usopp and Going Merry.
