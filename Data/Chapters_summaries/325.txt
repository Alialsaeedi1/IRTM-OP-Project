On Going Merry, the attackers explain they are known as the Franky Family and are bounty hunters who are after the Straw Hat Pirates bounties. Zoro easily defeats them using only two swords. At the Market District, Robin and Chopper explore the streets where they see a mask stall. She explains that there has been a number of masked people walking by talking about a costume party which is taking place. The two then come across a bookstore which Chopper rushes into. On her way to the store, Robin passes a tall masked man who whispers "CP9" making her expression turn to one of panic and worry. Inside the bookstore, Chopper realizes that Robin has disappeared and goes in search of her. Meanwhile, at a cashing exchange store, the three Straw Hats are offered 100 million belly for their gold to the excitement of Luffy and Usopp. Nami however, is not as happy and refuses to accept the offer mentioning Luffys bounty and the offer being wrong. At this, they are offered three times as much which is happily accepted by the three. They are all seen leaving the store with suitcases filled with 100 million belly each. The three of them decide to return to the shipyard to find out the price of repairs. Once back at the shipyard, they are stopped from entering by one of the workers who explains only workers are allowed in there. The worker, Kaku, who Luffy comically calls Usopp at first due to his long nose, is given the letter from Kokoro and explains that Iceburg is the mayor of Water 7 and the president of the Galley-La Company. After being told the location of the Straw Hat Pirates ship, Kaku decides he will check the ships condition and jumps of a cliff. The Straw Hats watch in shock while Iceburg explains to them that Kaku always does this and explains he is a chief mechanic from Dock 1.
