As the drawbridge lowers to provide access to the Tower of Justice, the Straw Hat Pirates yell that they will save Robin, and on the other side the members of CP9 laugh at the Straw Hats bravery but are confident that they cannot be defeated. At the left and right towers in the Courthouse Plaza, Mozu, Lulu, Kiwi, and Tilestone celebrate their success in lowering the drawbridge. Meanwhile, Baskerville confronts the Galley-La Workers while ordering the Marines to destroy the drawbridge. Paulie and Zambai attack him, splitting him in three, but Baskerville reveals that he is actually three people with different bodies: the one on the left is Bas, the one on the right is Kerville, and the one in the middle is Princess. Baskerville then orders the mortars to be fired, and the mortars stop the drawbridge. Baskerville yells at Spandam to flee from the Tower of Justice, and Spandam complies, dragging Robin away while ordering someone else to take Franky. Spandam gloated to the Straw Hats, saying he had CP9, Robin, and Franky, the latter of whom had the blueprints for the Pluton. However, Spandam runs into Franky, who much to his shock is holding out the blueprints to the Pluton, which he had kept in his body the entire time. Spandam tells Franky to give them to him, but Franky tells Robin that he knew she did not wish to abuse the Pluton as many believed, knowing that the mission of Tom and Iceburg was to keep the Pluton from falling into the wrong hands. Franky tells Spandam that if the blueprints fell into his hands, the world would fall into violence, although Spandam attempts to convince him that that would happen if Robin got them.
