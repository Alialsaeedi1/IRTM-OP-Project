Kuro demands to know how the Black Cat Pirates were beaten by a bunch of children. Jango states it was Kuro himself that said Usopp would not be a problem, but Kuro just states that the Black Cats are weaker than he thought they were. Buchi and Sham cannot believe what they are hearing. They try to argue that while Kuro has been leading a peaceful existence in the village, they have been fighting hard against other pirates and plundering other villages and that in three years they have gotten a lot stronger. They attempt to kill Kuro before he kills them, but to their horror Kuro dodges the attack. He appears behind them but when they turn to strike, he once again appears behind them again with his special weapons, the Cat Claws, pointing at the pairs throats. Jango comments how, with those weapons, Kuro can move silently and that Kuros habit of lifting up his glasses still makes his hair stand on end. Kuro tells the Nyaban Brothers they have 5 minutes to kill them or he will kill everyone. With renewed hope, the pair rush at Zoro. Nami kicks Zoro his swords, much to Zoros annoyance. With all three swords in his hands, Zoro easily defeats the pair with a single move. Zoro points his sword at Kuro and states he is next. However, attention is drawn to Buchi, who still has survived Zoros attack. Buchi demands that Jango hypnotize him so he can continue fighting. While Zoro tackles the hypnotized Buchi, Nami makes an attempt to wake Luffy up. Jango spots this and throws his ring at her.
