The four priests of God discuss the Class 2 crime the Straw Hat Pirates committed, and prepare for their punishment. As Luffy, Sanji and Usopp sail along the milky road, they arrive at a point where their route splits between four doors leading to a respective trial, each one bearing a name: Orb, String, Iron and Swamp. Luffy, casually suggests the trial of Orb, and the other two agree. As they enter the door, they go through a dark and long corridor. Luffy jokes about them picking the wrong door, and when they finally reach the exit, they start falling. Believing they have fallen off Sky Island, the three panic, but they land on what seems to be a continuation of the milky road, which leads them into a forest filled with various sized cloud orbs. As the three of them continue sailing, they get attacked by a giant snake, but Luffy sends it flying. Shortly afterwards, a large white orb blocks their path; when Sanji attempts to remove it by kicking it, the orb explodes in their faces. Suddenly, a voice is heard, explaining that these clouds are called "surprise orbs", and no one can predict what will appear from inside them. A man appears, and introduces himself as Satori, one of Enels priests. Sanji asks him if the rest of the crew are alright; he replies that he doesnt know, but even if they manage to escape custody, they would still end up dead. When Luffy tries to attack him, Satori predicts the attack and avoids it, before striking Luffy in the face with an impact dial attached to his palm. Sanji attacks him as well, but his moves are predicted by the priest again, by a power called Mantra. Usopp tries to fight, but gets beaten up as well. Satori sends the boat, the Straw Hats only means of reaching the sacrificial altar, sailing along the milky road. He then goes on to explain the trial of orb, stating that it has a survival rate of 10%.
