Nami scolds the Monster Trio (Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro) for being useless. Chopper thanks Gan Fall for helping them, but Gan Fall says it is his duty. Luffy says that he is unable to move normally and Robin states it is because of the scarce oxygen present in the place. Gan Fall asks the Straw Hats if they are citizens of Blue Sea, and explains that an average citizen of Blue Sea cannot stand here. He informs the Straw Hats that the White Sea is filled with a lot of danger and he would help them only if they pay him 5,000,000 for each call made by them through the whistle. He also states that the Knock Up Stream wasnt the only way to come up, making Nami cry over the difficulty she has had. He asks the Straw Hats if they lost any crew members and states that they are very brave to come here through such a dangerous method, earning his respect. He departs from the scene after giving the Straw Hats a whistle to call him. Robin remarks that they have not found any information relating to Sky Island. The crew then comes across a waterfall, they then sail to it until realizing it is blocked by a big cloudbank. Luffy decides to investigate the cloudbank. Luffy finds it is bouncy, saying it is soft like cotton, which makes Nami ponder about the phenomenon. He notices a huge door on the other side and Straw Hats check it out. They come across a door that is named as Heavens Gate, in which an old lady, whom she calls herself the "Watcher of the Gate", appears and asks them to pay a fee to access the island, though she states that it is not compulsory to pay the money. After the Straw Hats refuse to pay the fee, the seas speedy shrimp carries Going Merry to the island. Meanwhile, the gatekeeper is seen reporting to a "god" and his priests about seven pirate interlopers.
