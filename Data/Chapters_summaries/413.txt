Everyone is running from Enies Lobby to avoid the impending Buster Call. Nico Robin is running back the way she came. Spandam tells her that if she goes back, all she will see are pirate corpses. Spandam draws Funkfreed and uses Ivory Dart to stop her. Robin is pinned between Funkfreeds left tusk and sword trunk. Outside, Franky has pulled Chopper from the ocean and dragged him onto shore. Chopper has reverted to normal, but he is unconscious. As he is pumping the water out of Choppers body, he wonders how to get to the Gate of Justice. Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe conveniently appear to show Franky the way to the Gate of Justice. Franky then has a flashback of Nami giving him a baby Den Den Mushi and the 3rd and 4th keys. Franky then leaves Chopper in the hands of Kokoro and her granddaughter and heads toward the Gate of Justice. Back inside the tower, Jabra comments that they are wasting time, and Nami yells at Zoro and Sogeking for it. Zoro and Sogeking each blame the other for being an idiot. Kaku uses Rankyaku Sen, which Zoro intercepts. He tries to slice Kakus neck, but Kaku moves his neck out of the way, saying he gained the muscles to fully control his giraffe neck. Kaku then uses Bigan which Zoro blocks. Sogeking, Jabra, and Nami are watching the swordsmens fight from the sidelines. Sogeking then challenges Jabra. To his surprise, Jabra tosses his key at Sogekings feet. He tells Sogeking that he hates blood and fighting. Sogeking bends over to pick up the key. Nami tries to tell him its a trap, but before she can Jabra attacks Sogeking with Jusshigan. Sogeking hits the wall and Nami runs over to him. Sogeking fires a Himawariboshi from his Kabuto but Jabra dodges it with Soru. Jabra then kicks Sogekings head into the wall. Just as Jabra is about to kill Sogeking, Sanji flies in out of nowhere and lands a kick on the side of his head that sends him across the room. When Jabra asks Sanji who he is, Sanji tells him he is the hunter.
