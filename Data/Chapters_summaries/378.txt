Oimo and Kashii prepare to attack the Franky Family to prevent them from breaking into the main island of Enies Lobby. The Kairiki Destroyers attempt to match the giants strength. However, they are easily defeated by them despite being the strongest members of the Franky Family. Despite this, they are determined to open the gate and try their best to defeat the pair, however, their attempts fail. Just as it looks hopeless, Sodom and Gomorrah arrive and take down Kashii, with the assistance of Paulie, Zambai, Mozu and Kiwi. Meanwhile, Spandam hears a damage report from one of the marines located somewhere on the island, but before he could give the proper report, he is knocked out. This causes Spandam to believe there have only been five casualties rather than five hundred. Immediately afterwards, he is told that the other members of CP9 have arrived. Having already waited five minutes, those still on the Rocketman prepare to crash into Enies Lobby.
