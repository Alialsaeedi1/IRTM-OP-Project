The others watch as Nami makes her way down the stairs and leaps into the backstreets determined to save Luffy. As they yell to her to come back, Chopper, who thought there was sea anemone coming out of a chimney, realizes that it is Zoro and makes his way towards him to the shock of the others. As the shipwrights are about to chase after them, they are stopped by Paulie who states that if they all go it would no longer be a rescue and that if someone has to help, it will be him. Chimney watches in amazement while Kokoro admits it is too late now as the wave is already close to the island. Chopper finally reaches the chimney where Zoro is and Nami reaches as close a place to Luffy as she can and calls out to him. The wave continues to close in as she explains that Robin is going to die to prevent them from being attacked. Once finding this out, Luffy grows more determined while Zoro gets Chopper to hand his other katana over. The others watch in horror as the Aqua Laguna finally arrives about to cover everything underneath it, including the four Straw Hat Pirates. Just then, Luffy manages to push apart the buildings, grabs Nami and make their way to a higher building. Zoro slices the chimney with  Sanjuroku Pound Ho just as Chopper uses Jumping Point to get the pair to higher ground. As the four make it back to the bridge, they appear safe however, the Aqua Laguna crushes the bridge with its force.
