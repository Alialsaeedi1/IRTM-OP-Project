Usopp calls out to Luffy to wake up. The Marines still on the ships are stunned, as the pirates are defeating their captains with ease. Luffy looks up and sees Usopp looking down at him, surprised to see his friend there. Usopp still tries to sound bitter at Luffy, and tells him he only came to rescue Robin and not to see him. Usopp then challenges Lucci to a fight. Luffy tries to tell Usopp not to try and fight him, but Lucci tells him he has no business with someone who has been defeated, and everyone will soon be dead anyway. Luffy tells Usopp not to fight him as he will be killed. Usopp tells Luffy to stand up and stop pretending he is about to die. He then points out that they arent in Hell yet. Luffy gets up, as the soldiers and Vice Admiral Momonga watch the pirates fight the captains. Lucci is surprised that Luffy can still move. He then uses Life Return to bring himself to full power. Lucci uses Madara, which Luffy counters with Gomu Gomu no Gatling. Lucci then brings two fists forward and stops them in front of Luffy. Luffy feels determined not to get hit by Rokuogan again, but Lucci uses a technique called Sai Dai Rin Rokuogan, the most powerful form of Rokuogan. To Luccis amazement, Luffy is still standing. Luffy then remembers what Aokiji told him about how he would soon regret taking in Nico Robin as part of his crew. He then remembers Robins involvement in the whole thing from shooting Iceburg up until now. Lucci uses Tekkai, but it is instantly penetrated by Luffys Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling. Rob Lucci is punched into and through the wall. Lucci and Luffy land on the ground outside where they were fighting. Lucci is unconscious. Luffy then calls out to Robin that they are going back together, causing her to tearfully smile. The chapter ends with the battleships reporting the defeat of Rob Lucci.
