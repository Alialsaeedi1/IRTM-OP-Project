Sogeking, having entered the coach, explains to Robin that both Sanji and Franky are on the ship helping by diverting the attention of the others on the ship. He continues by informing her of the others who are also on their way to help save them. At this, Robin interrupts, telling him that she cannot leave and is informed that not only is Iceburg alive, he told them of her true reasons for departing the crew. As the pair begin to get their points across, they are interrupted by a knock at the door. Corgi enters the room and it is revealed that Sogeking is hiding under Robins cloak and he instantly becomes suspicious but does not notice him. In the fourth car, Sanji continues to fight Wanze who has instantly powered up since using his Ramen Suit. It is revealed that not only has he gotten more powerful, he can trap Sanji when he attacks him. At this, he decides to attack Wanzes face however, he uses another attack to prevent this explaining he has no weak spots at all and that he already knows Sanjis Fighting Style. However, Sanji begins to use chef knives explaining that since they are in a kitchen and the weapon hes up against is food, he could use his hands. Meanwhile, Franky and Nero have begun their battle, both appearing to be on par with one and other. The pair are both suspicious of the others fighting and defending style as the Puffing Tom is revealed to be twenty minutes away from reaching Enies Lobby.
