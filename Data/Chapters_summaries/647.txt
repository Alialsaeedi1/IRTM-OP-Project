The residents are amazed that the Straw Hats were able to defeat all the top members of the New Fish-Man Pirates. Everyone then runs out of the way as Wadatsumi falls from the sky. Back on the ground Jinbe is not surprised by the results of the battle, Sanji and Zoro get into an argument, Chopper and Usopp admire Sanji and Franky respectively, Franky feels inferior to Choppers monster form, Robin chastises Frankys General Franky, and Brook asks Nami to put on a miniskirt, much to her annoyance. All the citizens are starting to relax until they remember Noah is about to crash down on them. They beg Luffy to do something and save them. Luffy goes into third gear and begins to smash Noah as fast as he can. The citizens stand their ground and put their trust in Luffy. Fukaboshi and Neptune are sorry to have to destroy the ship, but lives must come first and Neptune apologizes to Joy Boy. As Luffy continues his barrage on the ship, Shirahoshi begs him to stop and blocks him. Luffy says the island will be destroyed if she does not get out of the way, but she tells him the ship has already stopped as they become surround by Sea Kings holding the chains from Noah in their mouths, much to Luffys shock. At this point Luffys wounds begin to open up, but he says it is okay as long as the ship stopped and everyone is safe. He then faints and falls back down to Noah. The Sea Kings begin to talk (only Shirahoshi can hear and talk to them) about how amazing the humans were and if they came only a bit later Fish-Man Island would have been saved, but Noah would have been destroyed. Shirahoshi says she did not do anything to call them there and the Sea Kings tell her that they were guided there by her strong feelings to help Luffy. The royal guards tell everyone on Fish-Man Island that the Sea Kings stopped the ship before it could be completely destroyed and that Fish-Man Island is saved. Luffy lands on Noah and everyone begins to celebrate.
