The Straw Hats set sail from Little Garden but are quickly confronted by an island devouring goldfish. Nami demands they maneuver away from the beast but recalling the giants words, Usopp and Luffy continue to sail the ship straight as commandedâ€”into the mouth of the beast. The giants, viewing this scene from Little Garden, remember the last time they met an island devouring sea beast. The giant duo, in unison, throw their weapons at the beast. They create a powerful attack that frees the Straw Hats from the beasts stomach. Dorry and Brogy then recall how the 100-year war had started with them. Many years ago, the two ruled Elbaf. When they both returned home with a large sea creature, they were asked whose was larger. They immediately began an argument and spent years attempting to settle the wage on who caught the larger fish. The mountains that appeared on the island, once zoomed out, are revealed to be the bones of the sea beasts they had caught in years past. In the present, the giants began feeling nostalgic but they heard the eruption of a volcano signaling another duel time. Meanwhile back on the Going Merry, Usopp promises to one day visit Elbaf, while Nami asks Vivi to navigate for a while. Sanji serves lunch to everyone while Zoro continues to train as he feels hes grown weak from lack of practice. Elsewhere in Arabasta, Mr. 2 prepares to leave for Little Garden and feels bothered having to waste his time. On the Going Merry, Nami collapses with a fever.
