The Straw Hat Pirates enters Yuba after it was hit by a sandstorm. Nobody is here except, Toto, digging in the sand. When Vivi ask him about the rebels, the old man reveals to them that, due to the drought Yuba faced for three years, the rebels had moved to Katorea, an oasis close to Nanohana, the city they have left before going to Yuba. When Luffy says Vivis name, the old man starts to cry, asking the princess if she remembers him. Vivi, in shock, realizes who he is and starts to remember their first encounter. Eleven years ago, a young kid named Koza asked King Cobra to stop the drought in his village because the villagers were suffering. When Cobra told him it is out of his power, Kozas father, Toto appeared, ashamed by his sons rudeness and begs the king to forgive them. Koza, being too proud to beg the king for forgiveness, rushed out of the room. Cobra was moved by the kids care for his fellow villagers and decides to allow them to live in Alubarna temporarily until they can decide on what to do. After confronting the king, Koza, in tears, ran out and encountered young Vivi, who called him a crybaby. This is the start of a fight between the two kids, which rapidly transformed into a friendship. Vivi became the sub-leader of the Suna Suna Clan, just under Koza. But one day, when Vivi was searching for her leader, she bumped into two dangerous men.
