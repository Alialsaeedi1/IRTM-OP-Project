Luffy pursues Moria, the latter of whom is distracting him while Oars tries to destroy the Straw Hats. Elsewhere, the rest of the Straw Hats confront Oars. Oars proceeds to attack everyone with a Gomu Gomu no Kama. Everyone is surprised that the zombie is able to use similar attacks like their captain. Chopper and Usopp are more shocked by the fact that Oars reach and strength is so great that he doesnt even need to stretch. Sanji attacks Oars on the head with Gollier Fri, but he immediately gets sent flying back. Franky notes the monsters great speed despite its massive size. Just as Oars is about to kill Sanji, Usopp stops him with his Firebird Star attack. Oars demolishes the building that Frankys group were standing on with a jump kick. Zoro tries to attack Oars head, but the latter docks and sends him flying with a kick, leaving Robin to later catch him with a Hand Net. Franky tries to shoot Oars down, but he too is unsuccessful in harming him. As Oars makes his way to the platform where the Straw Hats have regrouped, Usopp and Chopper attempt to stop him, but their efforts prove futile. Oars destroy the platform theyre standing on, leaving them all lying on the ground, barely conscious, mumbling over Luffy and his power.
