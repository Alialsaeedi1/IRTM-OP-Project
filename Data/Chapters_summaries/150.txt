While Chopper beats Chessmarimo, Wapol disappears into the castle without Luffy noticing. There he encounters Nami, who tries to escape Doctorines orders. Realizing she is part of Luffys crew, Wapol attacks her but she is saved by Luffy. Wapol enters the castle in order to eat all the weapons from the weapon storage room and to transform himself into a living weapon, however, his plan fails deplorably when he realizes he has lost the key. Nami reveals she had stolen the key from him when they had bumped into each other earlier. She had thought it was the key to the treasure room. Not giving up, Wapol climbs to a room where he can find his last trump card: the Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon. However, he is deceived once again, since the cannon has been invaded by Choppers bird friends. With no other tricks in his pocket, he has no other choice but to face Luffy.
