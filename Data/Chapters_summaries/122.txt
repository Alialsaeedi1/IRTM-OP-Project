While Brogy attempts to get up, Mr. 3 realizes he needs to use more force to keep him down. He creates four large swords from his Wax-Wax fruit powers and impales his hands and feet to the ground. Brogy screams as he is immobilized. Mr. 3 increases the speed of his Candelabra technique and explains that the Straw Hats will be turned into a group of wax statues, preserving the look of horror on their faces forever. Brogy once again attempts to free himself but fails. Zoro becomes inspired by the giants attempts to free himself and resolves to cut off his own legs to escape and fight his way to freedom. Brogy is impressed by the warriors honor and attempts one last time to free himself. Fortunately, Luffy, Karoo, and Usopp arrive before Zoro goes through with it and they vow to defeat the baroque works agents. Zoro requests Luffy to destroy the candle but Mr. 3 challenges that he will not allow it.
