The assault from the Buster Call continues and Luffys battle with Rob Lucci rages on. The battleships report that all Marine and World Government personnel are safely aboard. They also report twenty five pirates at the main gate. They also report that those pirates are all dead, much to everyones shock and horror, and that the only structure not obliterated was the Bridge of Hesitation. When Nami asks if people can just die so easily, Robin replies that humans cannot be seen on a map. She says that the Buster Call is erasing an island from the map, without any hesitation. Franky then yells for Luffy to hurry up. Back underground, Luffy is fighting Lucci after having activated Gear 2. Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol and blasts Lucci back. Lucci uses Shigan, but Luffy dodges it. They both punch each other but both block each others punch. Luffy then hits Gomu Gomu no Jet Bullet and hits Lucci in the stomach and follows it up with another Jet Pistol. Lucci then tells Luffy he will teach him the most powerful Rokushiki technique. He clenches his fists and brings them to Luffys stomach. He uses the technique, Rokuogan, to unleash a massive shockwave on Luffys body. Luffy compares it to the Impact Dial from Skypiea, only with a greatly amplified power. While Luffy is on the ground, Lucci uses Rankyaku Gaicho, causing an explosion. Chopper muses that it is almost like Luffy knows who he should fight from the start. A soldier reports to one of the vice admirals that they spotted Luffy, and he orders that all ships to make a battle formation around the Bridge of Hesitation.
