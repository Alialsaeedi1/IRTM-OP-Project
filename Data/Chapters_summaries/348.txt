CP9 explains that fire will rise from the first floor and that they plan to frame the Straw Hat Pirates for the chaos. The Straw Hats, angered by this, all prepare to attack. Robin turns to leave while the Straw Hats and Iceburg all try to stop her. Luffy charges towards her but is blocked by Blueno, who easily dodges all of Luffys attacks using Kamie and Soru. Using Geppo, Blueno appears to float in the air while Kalifa and Kaku attack using Rankyaku, sending Luffy flying back and cutting through the wall. Zoro attacks Kaku and questions his inspection of the Going Merry, however Kaku reveals that even though he was incognito, he was serious about the ships condition. The two continue to fight each other as Luffy notices Robin has finally reached the window. In a last-minute attempt to stop her, Luffy makes a start towards the window while Zoro is defeated by Kaku using Shigan. Luffy is caught and thrown against a wall by Lucci as Robin escapes through the window. Rob Lucci then explains that CP9 have trained since they were young and are always sent out to extreme missions. He states that they have a huge difference in combat power compared to the Straw Hats. Kalifa interrupts and announces that it is almost time for the fire to start as Rob Lucci states he has something interesting for them. Lucci then begins to transform into an unknown creature, shocking everyone there.
