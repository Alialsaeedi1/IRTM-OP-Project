As Pica makes his way toward the plateau where King Riku is located, the onlooking Donquixote underlings cheer him on, and various combatants wonder how they can stop him. Seeing Pica moving toward the king, Elizabello II prepares to use his King Punch, but Zoro stops him. After explaining how Pica will simply reform his body, he asks Elizabello to wait two minutes before running to Orlumbus and asking him to throw him. Some people firing cannons at Pica are crushed by him, prompting Riku to reveal his location and beg Pica to stop. Riku orders Tank Lepanto and Viola to get everyone to safety while he remains where he is to draw Picas attack. Across the island, Orlumbus asks Zoro if he is sure about his plan despite the dangers, but Zoro insists that there is no time for anything else. As Pica begins to attack Riku, Orlumbus hurls Zoro toward the executive. Zoro coats his swords with Busoshoku Haki and begins a technique, claiming that there is nothing in this world that he cannot cut. Pica tells Riku that he is not fit to be king if he cannot defeat his enemies, and that he failed to protect his country because he loves peace too much. Riku admits that Pica is correct, but cries that he is proud of the fact that he has remained human and will not take another life in order to survive. Laughing, Pica claims that good people like Riku are killed and forgotten by history, but before his attack can connect, Zoro cuts his stone body in half. Pica moves to the top half of the enormous stone body, but Zoro simply cuts that in two, and continues cutting the statue until Pica is forced to emerge. Pica coats his body in Busoshoku Haki and attempts to attack his opponent while claiming that Zoro can never cut through him. Zoro responds that all he needs is a stronger Haki and cuts Pica down in mid-air. As Pica is defeated, Elizabello uses his King Punch to blast away the rest of Picas stone body, bemoaning the fact he is merely doing clean up.
