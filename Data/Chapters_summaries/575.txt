The chapter starts with a flashback of Ace and Luffy having a drink and becoming brothers. Everyone is sad because of Aces death. Ivankov notes that Luffy has mentally collapsed and that his life is now in danger. Akainu attempts to kill Luffy, but Marco interrupts the attack. Marco orders Jinbe to take Luffy with him. Marco swears that the Whitebeard Pirates will protect him in place of Ace and if they let him die, they would consider it shame on the entire Whitebeard Pirates. Whitebeard, who was observing the situation, attacks Akainu from the back without saying a word. Akainu goes down and his face is covered in blood. Akainu retaliates with a punch that takes out a portion of Whitebeards head. Whitebeard then punches Akainu a second time which also causes massive destruction to the Marine HQ itself. Akainu falls into the crevice created by Whitebeard and is therefore beaten by him. The Marineford plaza is split in two by the crevice and the pirates are separated from Whitebeard. Sengoku comments on how Whitebeard still has this much power, even after losing a portion of his head. The pirates are getting back to the ship. Boa Hancock tells her snake pet Salome that she is worried about Luffy. The Blackbeard Pirates are then spotted standing on the execution platform with some additional members. Sengoku, shocked by their presence, questions how they got there. Doflamingo just comments how awesome it is that they got a great guest. Blackbeard himself says that he is glad he got there in time to see Whitebeard die.
