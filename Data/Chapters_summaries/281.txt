Ark Maxim first flight has begun, named Deathpiea, savior of the world amidst in hopelessness as per Enels description. Aisa and Pierre tried to board Maxim but the ark stopped mid way. Something happening inside the ark and large smoke starts billowing on top of it. Nami wondered what was it and Enel is laughing. The Shandia noticed the black smoke and felt disturbed. Enel said, it was a thunder cloud produced by the ark which could stores strong electrical current by using his energy and will be able to emit thunders ten times stronger than Enels power and soon will cover entire Skypiea, then he demonstrates how it works. A thunder from the cloud strikes the Angel Island while being witnessed by the citizens. Enel continues laughing and attacked Luffy with his trident. Luffy evaded it by spinning in mid air and swings his leg to Enel, and blocked Luffys attack with his hand but Luffy landed his leg on the hot trident which causes his leg to burn. Enel strikes Luffy again with his hot trident and forces Luffy to defend it with his hand which causes burn on Luffys hand. Luffy still could not fight Enel due to his mantra and come up with "gomu gomu baka" and turned himself into a dumb person. Surprisingly, it really affects Enel and could not hit him. Luffy uses "gomu gomu octopus" and Enel said Luffy is trying hard to overcome the mantra because it is how he dominate his opponents. Luffy came up with another idea, then dashes to the throne and starts punching and kicking the wall which causes his punches and kicks deflected backward randomly and hitting Enel. He tried to attack Luffy for the second time but failed once again and thrown away after receiving Luffys attack. Enel stands up and unable to evade Luffys incoming "gomu gomu no bazooka" and finishes it with "gomu gomu no rifle".
