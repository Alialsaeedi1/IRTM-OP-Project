Franky is seen falling off the roof of the Puffing Tom injured by Nero who has taken advantage of his weakness. As he begins to mock Franky who is holding on to the side of the train, he is tricked and his arms and legs are locked down by Franky who smashes him through the roof of the third car. There, he meets with Sanji and the CP9 who are all now onto their feet. Kaku explains that Nero is the new member of CP9 as he gets up onto his feet. At this, Rob Lucci gravely injures Nero explaining that he was too weak since he only knew four of the forms. Lucci continues to explain that it is worthless trying to save Robin and reveals that the reason she was given such a bounty at a young age was due to the fact she has the ability to wake one of theÂ Ancient Weapons. Angered by this, Sanji attacks Lucci just as Robin enters the room with Sogeking having defeated Corgi. Sanji happily questions her on how she is while Franky notes that she looks like the girl in the bounty. However, she throws Sogeking stating how her words appear meaningless to them. Just then, Sogeking declares to Franky to detach the third car as he throws a smoke star as he grabs Robin and the four make their escape.
