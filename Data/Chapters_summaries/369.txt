The CP9 are informed of the last two coaches being disconnected and that those in the fifth coach have been easily defeated. It is revealed that Nico Robin is in the first cart of the train and that the CP9 and Wanze are the only ones left to prevent her from being taken. They are also informed of the attackers appearances and conclude that the only thing they have to do is take both Franky and Nico Robin to Enies Lobby alive. They decide to focus on capturing Franky since saving Robin is impossible. Meanwhile, on Coach Four, Wanze continues to prevent them from passing and Sanji decides to fight him while the other two progress to the next coach. He continues to prevent them from passing until Sanji attacks making him dodge and allowing the other two to pass. Wanze explains that Nero is in the next coach before being kicked by Sanji twelve times. Due to this, he uses Ramen Kenpo to create an armor around him. Franky is greeted by Nero on the roof of the next coach and it is explained he cannot kill him since they need him alive. Franky lands the first hit after tricking Nero stating that he plays dirty since he is the underworld boss of his town. In the first coach, Nico Robin hears a knock at the window and is shocked to see Sogeking there.
