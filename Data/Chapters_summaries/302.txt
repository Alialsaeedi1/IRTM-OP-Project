The Shandia are still confused as to why the Straw Hat Pirates ran off before they could present them with their gift. They questioned whether the Straw Hats knew how grateful they were for their help. Gan Fall says that he will never understand the minds of the young pirates. Meanwhile, Raki trimmed Aisas hair, she commented that Aisa was sly in regards to saying farewell to the Straw Hats as she was the only one who managed to do so. Aisa replies that it was because Luffy said that it was a secret and that  the warriors of the blue seas are strong. She wishes that she could become like him and stretch her arms really far. Afterwards, Raki tells Aisa that she will not cut too much of her hair this time because the latter no longer needed to keep her hair short or to carry weapons because of the islands peace which causes Aisa to smile.
