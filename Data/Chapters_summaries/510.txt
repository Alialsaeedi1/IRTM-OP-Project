Apoo joins the battle and manages to knock Kizaru down. Apoo uses this chance to make a quick escape, but Kizaru quickly gets up and easily knocks out Apoo, Drake and Hawkins. Kizaru is then seen talking to Sentomaru on a Baby Den Den Mushi who is telling Kizaru to quickly capture Luffy, Law and Kid. Back at Grove 12, where the Straw Hats are fighting the copy of Kuma, Zoro gets knocked out by Kuma since his wounds from his previous battle with Kuma have not yet healed. Chopper successfully manages to land a "Roseo Metel" attack on Kuma. Kuma quickly recovers and just as Kuma is about to attack Chopper, Franky attacks with "Strong Hammer" and "Franky Boxing". Kuma quickly retaliates and punches Franky but Robin saves Franky just before he hits the ground with "Spider Net". Brook then attempts a "Swallow Bond En Avant" from the air but Kumas tough skin prevents any damage. Usopp barely manages to save Brook with "Atlas Suisei" just as Kuma is about to fire a beam at him. Kuma then targets Nami with one of his beams but Robin closes his mouth with "Ochenta Fleur: Cuatro Mano Shock" causing Kuma to fire the blast in his own mouth giving Nami the chance to unleash a "Thunder Lance Tempo" on him. This does little however, except for making the copy mad. He then goes "berserk" and Zoro tells Sanji to send Kuma toward him. Sanji then attacks with "Diable Jambe, Flambage Shoot" kicking him to Zoro who unleashes "Asura, Makyusen". Luffy then activates Gear Third and uses "Gigant Rifle" with the chapter ending there.
