Franky states he will dismantle the Going Merry to the shock of everyone in the hideout. He continues to explain the reason he will do so is because Usopp stated he wants to return home and not throw his life away along with the boat. He states that a boats wish is to "carry you from this land to that land" and that it can no longer keep that wish. Usopp watches in horror as Franky begins to rip apart the Going Merry and attempts to stop him. With the attack failed, Franky slams Usopp into the water to see for himself to the shock of the onlooking Mozu and Kiwi. Underwater, Usopp has no choice but to look at the severely damaged keel of Merry. Trying to ignore the problem, he continues to fix Merry after coming out of the water as Mozu and Kiwi look on saddened. Franky continues to explain however, Usopp admits that he already knew that Going Merry could no longer travel. He continues to explain the night in Skypiea where he saw the ghost repairing the ship and explains he believes it to be the incarnation of Going Merry. Franky describes the appearance of the ghost shocking Usopp and continues to explain that what he saw was a Klabautermann. He explains that it is a legend of a fairy that dwells on well cared ships and that it is indeed more or less the ships incarnation. It apparently helps out in many ways, the main one being the spirit warning the crew when the ship is in danger. As they finish their discussion, a knock is heard at the door: the CP9 have arrived.
