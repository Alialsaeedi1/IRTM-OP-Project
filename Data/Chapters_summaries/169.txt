Luffy noisily enters the casino and demands that Crocodile show himself which disturbs a lot of the people in there. Smoker then runs into the casino as well. While Luffy takes care of the security, the Straw Hats are then escorted to the V.I.P room but this turns out to be a ruse as they fall into a trap. The trapped members of the Straw Hats then start fighting along with Smoker who explains that the prison is made of sea stone, an item that is basically a solid form of the sea which hampers devil fruit power. Crocodile then appears to the prisoners, saying that he is awaiting Vivi and has sent for Miss All Sunday to pick her up. Meanwhile, Vivi is fighting several members of Baroque Works. When Pell arrives and defeats the Baroque Works members, he is then confronted by Miss All Sunday.
