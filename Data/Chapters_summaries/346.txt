After knocking out all of the shipwrights, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper run inside the Galley-La Headquarters while Luffy frees himself and Paulie from the restraints. All of them head towards Iceburgs room. Meanwhile, Rob Lucci explains to Iceburg about the existence of Cipher Pol and CP9. He states the reason CP9 is not known to exist is because they have permission to kill anyone who does not cooperate. He continues by revealing that the World Government wishes to resurrect the ancient weapons in the name of justice. As Rob Lucci decides to explain their theory while Kaku keeps track of Iceburgs pulse, he explains that its odd that he would not try to hand down the real Pluton blueprints after being attacked, not unless he had already done so. As for the fakes, they are signed by Toms Workers; Tom, Iceburg and Cutty Flam. He continues that Iceburgs mistake was that he thought that his enemies were not so close to him so they know of Toms Workers whom are surrounded in mysteries so much so that it took them ages to deduce that Iceburg was a disciple and that the other, Cutty Flam, was confirmed dead 8 years ago by a government officer. However, the four of them remember that a year after they had arrived, a man arrived to see Iceburg and named himself only once. Cutty Flam is still alive and in Water 7 known by the name Franky, who had any opportunity to receive the Pluton blueprints since he was there selling material. It is stated that Iceburgs pulse confirms that it is all true. Just as CP9 are about to escape, they are interrupted by Luffy, Paulie, Zoro, Nami and Chopper.
