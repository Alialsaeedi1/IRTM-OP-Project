Zoro asks the crew if it is possible for someone to stand on top of water. The crew is confused as it is physically impossible for someone to stand on water. Zoro then asks how they would explain why there is a man standing on water, which prompt the crew to look at what Zoro is pointing at. They all spot the strange man standing on water. The man then makes a comment about the cold weather. The crew agree it is cold. Suddenly, the water at the mans feet erupts and a ship appears. Sanji, who has been taking care of Nami, rushes outside to see what has happened. He stops to light a cigarette and asks what happened. Luffy responds that they were ambushed. Sanji comments that that is obvious as they are surrounded by pirates. The Captain of said pirates then wonders where there other crew members are, as they should have more than 4 members. He then asks them if they know how to get to Drum kingdom to which Sanji replies that they do not. The mysterious captain then starts eating the going merry much to the shock of the crew, and this angers Luffy who starts a fight and attacks the captain who eats him just as Vivi comes out to see whats going on. Luffy then finishes his attack and blows the captain away, who Vivi feels she has met before.
