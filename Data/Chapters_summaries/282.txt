Enel is knocked back by Luffys Gomu Gomu no Rifle, but he doesnt stay down for long. The self-proclaimed god rises once more, berating Luffy for interfering with his plans. All while causing the Ark Maxim, to rise once more. The people of Sky Island flee as they bare their eyes to the colossal ship. Far off in the ruins, Nico Robin is also shocked by the sight of the ship. Back on the Ark Maxim Enel taunts Luffy, exclaiming that Sky Island is doomed and nothing will be able to save it. Angered, Luffy proceeds to attack Enel once more. Determined not to lose to Luffy once more, Enel uses his thunder alchemy to trap Luffys arm in a golden ball. Luffy yells at Enel to free him, but the latter ignores the formers pleas and proceeds to kick him off the ship. He mockingly tells Luffy that hes welcome to keep the gold. Luffy still holds on, clinging on to the ship desperately for his life. He tells Enel that the sea is full of monstrous people like himself to defeat. Enel then angrily proceeds to kick Luffy once more and sends him falling to a great depth. Aisa, riding Pierre, watches as Luffy falls and attempts to save him. However, their efforts prove to be futile as Enel strikes all three of them down with his lightning as Nami looks on with horror. He then proceeds to strike her down next. Meanwhile, Conis notices that Sanji and Usopp are missing and questions where they could have gone off to with their injuries. Below the Ark Maxim, Sanji and Usopp are seen climbing the ship.
