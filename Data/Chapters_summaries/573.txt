All the pirates are trying to evacuate, while Whitebeard holds all the marines back alone. Meanwhile, the visual Den Den Mushi wakes up and Buggy restarts the broadcast and prepares to take Whitebeards head. At the same time Jinbe also decides to stay back to help Whitebeard and evacuate pirates. While Ace is on his way to freedom, Akainu provokes him to turn back by insulting Whitebeard. An enraged Ace clashes with Akainu, but Ace ended up getting burned by Akainus Magu Magu no Mi powers. Ace then learns the hard way that Akainus logia fruit with the power of magma is the natural enemy and superior to that of Aces logia with the power of fire.
