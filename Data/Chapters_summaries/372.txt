Franky and Nero continue to battle upon the roof of the Puffing Tom. Neru uses Rankyaku: Sen, which Franky blocks with his Star Shield. Nero notes to himself that Franky cannot possibly be human. Franky fires a barrage of nails from his mouth, prompting Nero to dodge using Geppo. Noting that he has not mastered Shigan, Nero pulls out a couple of pistols as Franky attempts to move onto the next car. Franky reveals that he tricked Nero into rushing to attack him, turning around and uses Beans Left. Nero dodged the attack and appeared behind Franky, proclaiming that he figured him out, and fires his pistols at Frankys back, causing him pain and identifying Frankys back as his weakness. Franky attempts to use Ouch Finger but Nero dodges using Soru and uses Rankyaku, which Franky dodges. In order to mitigate his weakness, Franky decides to lay flat on his back. Asking Nero if he has heard of a centaur, Franky uses Franky Kentauros to comedically transform into a "reverse" Centaur. Meanwhile in the kitchen, Sanji has destroyed both of the Ramen Suits arms and as Wanze attempts to attack using his feet, the legs are also destroyed before the whole suit itself is cut into pieces. It is then that Sanji begins to continuously kick Wanze, while he is insulting Robin, to the point of completely altering his appearance. Sanji says that Wanze committed three crimes: calling himself a chef, wasting food, and speaking ill of his friend. Unhappy with his new appearance, Wanze goes to attack Sanji once again, however, he is sent flying into the second car where the CP9 are.
