Zoro stands seemingly victorious after slicing up Buggy. However, as he goes to free Luffy from his cage, Buggys crew starts laughing. Nami questions to herself why the crew is doing so when Zoro suddenly finds himself struck in the side by a hand holding a knife. Buggy floats behind Zoro as he finds himself fighting the hand and boasts about his Devil Fruit powers, the Bara Bara no Mi. Buggy sees he missed Zoros vital parts, but Zoro is still injured and finds that he needs rescuing even though he had initially come to rescue Luffy. While Nami is simply shocked about the whole thing, Luffy calls Buggy "Big Nose" while claiming he is a jerk for striking Zoro in the back. Buggy gets angry and sends his hand out again, this time to kill Luffy; however, Luffy grasps the knife between his teeth. As Luffy claims he will finish Buggy, Buggy and his crew laugh. Luffy tells Zoro to escape, but Nami does not understand. Zoro, however, gets the idea of what Luffy is going to do. Zoro attempts to escape, but Buggy launches his Bara Bara no Hou. Zoro heads for the cannon and turns it over to face Buggy and his crew. Nami lights the fuse and the cannon fires at the Buggy Pirates, destroying part of the rooftop theyre in. Zoro asks who Nami is and, while she says she is just a thief, Luffy tells him she is their navigator. Nami denies Luffys statement and follows behind them. While Buggys crew is down for the count, Zoro goes to Luffy and, ignoring the request to find a way to open the cage, he grabs it and makes a break for it before Buggy fully recovers. Buggys crew begins to find their bearings and find all three of them gone, as well as the key to Luffys cage. Buggys crew starts to search the town, but Zoro and Luffy are on a rooftop. Furious, Buggy declares war on them.
