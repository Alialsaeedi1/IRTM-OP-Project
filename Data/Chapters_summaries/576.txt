After the escaped Level 6 inmates of Blackbeards crew have been quickly highlighted, Whitebeard and Blackbeard begin to fight each other. Blackbeards Yami Yami no Mi powers negate Whitebeards Gura Gura no Mi powers but Whitebeard still gains the upper hand as he exclaims that he could never call Blackbeard "son" after everything he has done. There is a flashback of a conversation between Whitebeard and Roger in which Roger offers to tell Whitebeard how to get to Laugh Tale to claim the One Piece. Whitebeard turns him down saying treasure is not what he is after. Roger notes that everyone is calling him Gold Roger when he is Gol D. Roger. Whitebeard inquires about the D and its meaning and Roger tells him off panel. Meanwhile, as Whitebeard nearly kills Blackbeard by using his quake powers at point blank range. He cryptically says that Blackbeard is not the person Roger was waiting for but rather someone who will bear the weight of all those centuries upon his back (of people passing their will to the next generation) to challenge the world in a massive war. There is another flashback conversation where a much younger Whitebeard tells an unknown pirate that he is not interested in treasure. He just wants family. He apologizes to his sons for leaving Blackbeard for them to deal with, thanks them and bids them a final farewell. Whitebeard is eulogized by the narrator listing all the injuries he had taken in this war yet his back, where his jolly roger is tattooed, bears no marks or scars of retreat as Whitebeard dies standing up.
