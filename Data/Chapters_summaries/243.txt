The Straw Hat Pirates talk their situation out, trying to find a solution, while Pagaya and Conis sadly announce that they cannot help them anymore, since they are wanted men. Luffy calms everyone, stating that, either way, they are used to being chased by the authorities. He then argues with Nami about whether they should go to the forbidden land or not. Zoro interrupts the argument, wondering if there is actually a way to return to the Blue Sea. Conis explains that right now there is no safe route for them to follow, but they can return to the White Sea, head towards the clouds end. As they decide to set sail, Luffy asks for food supplies and Usopp for some tools to repair the ship. Little did they know, that Luffy had not given up on the idea of going to the forbidden land. Although Nami keeps protesting, they all know that if Luffy sets his mind on something, he will do it no matter what. As Sanji prepares the lunch boxes and Usopp gathers his tools, they notice the ship being dragged in the sea, against their crew mates will, by a giant shrimp, accompanied by sea monsters, to assure the criminals will not escape. Pagaya explains that the ship is taken to the sacrificial altar, the northeast portion of Upper Yard, where they will either be sacrificed to the God, or be simply trialed. In other words, the ship and people in her are taken hostages, and it is the ones left behind who have to go through a series of trials, in order to save them. After explaining the way to get there, Pagaya warns Luffy that apart from the quite strong priests, God Enel himself resides on Upper Yard, too.
