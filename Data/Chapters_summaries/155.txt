In Arabasta, the Warlord Crocodile is seen as a hero. Indeed we see him helping in the fight against pirates and be the subject of adoration by the people of Arabasta. Even Vivis father king Cobra thanks him for his help. Back on the Going Merry, Vivi explains these facts to the others. Arabasta people cannot imagine that the person who they see as a hero, is the one that is currently ruining their country. As a consequence, they have to stop the rebellion and then get rid of Baroque Works. When asked by Usopp about how the organization works, Vivi tells them of the pyramidal hierarchy and the main officer agents. But for Crocodile to take over Arabasta means that all the top agents are together somewhere in Vivis country.
