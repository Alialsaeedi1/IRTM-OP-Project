Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp are amazed by the priests power, who taunts them, telling them they have to hurry and beat him in order to catch up with their boat. Luffy sends the other two to find the Karasumaru, saying that he will take care of their enemy. He attacks Satori, but his moves get predicted again, and he is easily defeated. Satori turns his attention to Usopp and Sanji, attacking them with his orbs and stalling them, until Luffy returns to the fight. Luffys punches not only miss their target, but hit all the nearby floating orbs, setting off all their hidden surprise traps at once. During the attack, Usopp finds the time to use his rope weapon to reach the boat; while this reaches the boat, it is not entirely successful, as he forgot to detach the rope from his belt, and is dragged along underneath. Satori lands a very powerful attack with an impact dial on Sanjis chest, stating that the other two are next. Meanwhile, back on Going Merry, Chopper has been left alone to guard her; when one of Enels priests, Shura, arrives to collect the sacrifices, Chopper panics, blowing the whistle to summon Gan Fall, the Knight of the Sky, in a desperate call for help.
