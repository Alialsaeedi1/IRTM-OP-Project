Sanji and Franky, knowing Sogekings true identity, decide not to hurt his feelings, and the three make up a strategy to save Robin. Since they have already searched the first two coaches, Robin could possibly be in any one of the other five and they decide not to fight pointless battles. Meanwhile on the Rocketman, the remaining Straw Hats have changed clothes and Nami explains to them that before leaving, Usopp perfected her Clima-Tact using Dials which gets both her and Luffy depressed because of the mention of Usopp. Back aboard the Puffing Tom, Corgi informs the CP9 of the intruder and escaped criminals; they conclude that if anyone has sneaked aboard, it must have been before they departed the station and that they must calm down and search for them. The three make an appearance at the rear entrance of the seventh coach, where T Bone currently is, and the marines call for everyone to get there. T Bone slices the door open however, they have disappeared as the others arrive in the coach. T Bone, realizing that this is a trap, demands everyone to get to the other coaches however, it is too late for them as their coaches have been detached from the Puffing Tom and are left motionless on the tracks. On the fifth coach, the three are attacked by World Government Workers whom they easily defeat and it is revealed to Sanji and Sogeking that Franky is a cyborg. It is also revealed that only the front of Franky is cyborg but his back is still normal since he could not reach that area. After the distraction of this, they decide to make their way to the next coach where they meet Wanze, who after a comical greeting, prepares for battle.
