Sanji, who has hired a bull, is seen shopping for ingredients while dreaming of going on a date with Nami and Robin.Â Lost on his way to buy more ingredients, he spots Robin with the masked man walking past another building. She appears to ignore Sanji while he shouts over and runs towards the direction she was going. However, when he reaches there, both Robin and the masked man have disappeared. Joking about how she may be able to fly, he looks up and spots Kaku whom he mistakes for Usopp. Kaku arrives at the Going Merry where Zoro also mistakes him for Usopp. However, after thinking about it, he realizes he was mistaken and demands to know who he is. At Dock 1, Kalifa explains to Iceburg who the Straw Hat Pirates are and what their collective bounty is. Iceburg formally introduces himself to them as well as his newly adopted rat, Tyrannosaurus. Kalifa reminds him of his many duties he has to do that day however he tells her he does not want to do his duties and she cancels them all, causing the Straw Hats to call him unreliable. This causes Kalifa to attack them although it is Iceburg who appears to have taken all the kicks. Nami hands the letter from Kokoro saying to "Check Out Their Ship" which Iceburg instantly rips after reading. Despite this, he agrees and admits the reason he ripped the letter is because he did not like the kiss mark and that Kokoro was his drinking partner. Since they have to wait for Kakus return and he has nothing better to do despite just cancelling all his appointments, he offers to show them around Dock 1. Usopp notices the members of the Franky Family stealing their money and alerts the others. At the same time, one of the Galley-La Company carpenters who was seen before, Paulie, is being chased by debt collectors. To escape them, he jumps onto the Straw Hats bulls and easily defeats the Franky Family. Usopp thanks Paulie for saving their money however, after finding the suitcases, he leaves with the money.
