The White Berets crawl cautiously towards Luffy, much to his surprise and his crews concern. McKinley reveals a photo of the Straw Hats taken by Amazon, which confirms that they are the illegal trespassers. While Pagaya tries to reason with them and the others wonder what this is all about, McKinley assures them that their crime is not so serious (class 11) and that if they pay a fine of ten times the entry fee, they can go back to be considered regular tourists. That still seems a lot for the Straw Hats to pay, so they try to negotiate. At that time Nami arrives at the beach. When she gets informed by Usopp about the fine, she gets so mad that she drives her Waver straight on McKinleys face, sending him flying. Pagaya warns Luffy and his crew that they are in danger, to which they agree and decide to make a run for it. A bloodied McKinley stops them, announcing that their crime is now of class 5 and sentences them to drifting cloud, a small cloud that drifts in the sky with no chance of getting off, in other words a death penalty. The White Berets proceed to attack the crew, using cloud arrows and dials, but Luffy, Zoro and Sanji manage to defeat them relatively easy. McKinley, though, warns them that they have now become class 2 criminals and that they will now be judged by the relentless Priests of Upper Yard.
