On Angel Island, the White Berets spot Conis arriving and recognize her as Pagayas daughter. In the ruins of Shandora, Enel asks Nami if she needs to bring along her waver. He says she will not need it where they are going, but ultimately does not care either way. He then takes her inside a cave, where he shows her the Ark Maxim, a massive flying ship powered by his lightning using a special gold from Upper Yard that transforms lightning into mechanical energy. Nami is left scrambling for answers, as she will not be able to escape with the waver in midair, and Enel looks forward to going to Fairy Vearth. Outside in the city, Nola is sleeping when Luffy forces its eyelid open from the inside. After briefly arguing with Aisa, the two of them and Pierre escape from Nola through its yawning mouth. Luffy climbs a tower and expresses his excitement at escaping, and realizes that they are in Shandoras ruins, where the bell should be; Aisa notes that this must be her peoples homeland. Luffy then sees a giant hole in the ground nearby as well as something else, and leaps down to check it out. Aisa and Pierre catch up to him, and find him shouting at the unconscious Zoro, Robin, Chopper, and Gan Fall, wondering what happened to them and where Nami is. Aisa then sees the unconscious Wyper in the hole and becomes distressed. Luffy wonders who could have done this, and Aisa responds that it could only have been Enel. Robin then regains consciousness and coughs, causing Luffy to go to her and ask who took Nami away. Robin does not know, but reveals that the entirety of Skypiea will soon be destroyed. As the Shandian villagers look for Aisa and the White Berets chase after Conis through the first gate, Aisa notes that Enel and Nami will be going to where the Gold Bell is, hearing both of their "voices". Luffy then tells Aisa to take him there.
