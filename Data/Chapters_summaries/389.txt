On the tower, everyone is responding to Luffys call to Robin. Luffy hears his stomach gurgling and pulls out the meat he stuffed in his pockets and eats it to restore his strength after fighting the Marines. Spandam notices Blueno is knocked out behind Luffy. Shocked that a Rokushiki expert and Devil Fruit user with a Douriki over 800 could be defeated by Luffy, Spandam panics a little and orders his men to gather Lucci and the others, as well as sends a message to Judge Baskerville not to let the Straw Hats lower the drawbridge or hed lose all three of his heads. With the attention drawn away from them, Franky tries to talk to Robin about the rescue effort in a bid to make her change her mind about her situation. Spandam orders the pair brought to him as he will head straight to the Gates of Justice. Attention is drawn as Frankys rear has expanded. Franky claims he senses his life is near its end, so hes chosen to self-destruct and he wants to take out some of his men with him. In a state of panic, Spandam begs him to stop so that he can live and the men all flee in a panic. Franky grabs Robin with his legs and lets go of the built up gas in a Coup de boo, which launches the pair away from Spandam and his men. Franky breaks down the net surrounding the ledge preventing Luffy getting to them. He slightly overshoots the tower but once the chains holding him are broken he manages to pull him and Robin back in. Seeing Robin alive makes Luffy happy, he is surprised at seeing Franky also. As Luffy prepares to launch himself over to Robin, Robin tells him to stop, as she has already told him she refuses to go back to the Straw Hats. She tells Luffy she never asked them to rescue her and is not happy they are as she wants to die. Hearing her response makes Spandam laugh, before Franky can react, Kaku knocks him aside. CP9 now gathers on the tower.
