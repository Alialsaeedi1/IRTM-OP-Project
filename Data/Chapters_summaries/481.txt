The Rolling Pirates and zombies of Thriller Bark announce that Oars has finally been defeated. While the Straw Hats rest after the decisive battle, Usopp immediately realizes the fight isnt over yet as he yells to Luffy to get everyones shadows. Lola suggests to beat Moria awake and make him give the shadows back, as the sun is about to rise. Moria, regaining consciousness, says there is no need to wake him as he proclaims to Luffy that he wrecked so much havoc over his Thriller Bark. Moria tells Luffy that even though he has a fine crew, they are nowhere near ready for the New World. As Moria proclaims that due to him losing his comrades while they were alive and that zombies are immortal, he proceeds to absorb many shadows from the entirety of Thriller Bark, using his Shadows Asgard technique. Moria deduces that Luffy had absorbed 100 shadows to become Nightmare Luffy, noting that while he is growing big, he is absorbing 1,000 shadows into his own body. Moria, showcasing his new strength from absorbing 1,000 shadows, proceeds to punch the ground, creating a huge fissure. The morning sun begins to peek throughout the island, exposing a pirates body as he proceeds to disappear, prompting the others to hide in the shade of the buildings and the forest for the time being. As the Rolling Pirates are retreating, Lola stays put, noting the Straw Hats are also not retreating despite also missing their shadows, and also telling them that since they got the Straw Hats into this mess, they should stand firm along with them and not flee. As Luffy tells his crew that he is going to go wild and that they should take care of everything afterwards, Zoro and Robin note that Moria is barely in control of himself and that hes given up on reason in exchange for power due to his pride. Activating Gear 2, Luffy prepares his final battle with Moria.
