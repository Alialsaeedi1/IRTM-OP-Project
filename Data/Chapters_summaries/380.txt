Since Spandam is not answering, Baskerville commands that one hundred law-guard-corps are to defeat those at the front gate. Oimo continues to guard the entrance, however, Mozu and Kiwi have managed to unlock the gate and only need someone to push it open. Before he can attack them however, Paulie ties his rope around him and with the help of Sodom and Gomorrah, causing him to spin round and round while the others open the gate and run through. Outside, the defeated guards notice the Rocketman speeding towards the gate, with no sign of slowing down in the slightest. Yokozuna manages to smash the gate to an angle, causing the train to fly over the first gate. However, there appears to be no way to land safely. Oimo finally appears to have fallen and the group made up of the Franky Family and Galley-La Company are seen standing upon his back. However, the Watchdog Unit of the Law appear and Paulie is stabbed by one, although luckily it is not fatal. Oimo gets back onto his feet only for the Rocketman to smash into his back. At first it appears unlikely any of them are okay, however all of them turn out to be okay. Zoro and Sanji take down a vast number of the enemy in seconds, when the Marines attack them.
