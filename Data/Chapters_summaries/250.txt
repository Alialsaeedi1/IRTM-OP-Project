Gan Fall falls defeated into the water and Chopper, in desperation, dives after him to save him, despite being a Devil Fruit user. Fuza, with a hit, sends Pierre to join them. Sure about his victory, Shura decides to go after the other escapees. Back in the forest, Satori has taken the upper hand in his battle against Luffy, Sanji and Usopp. Luffy attacks the priest but he dodges and sends a dragon made of orbs against his opponent. Usopp takes this chance to try and retrieve their boat. Luffy notices that the dragon is controlled by a rope and he cuts it loose. Satori pulls Luffy with the remaining rope towards him, but Luffy still holds the dragon on the other hand, which he throws on the scared priest, causing a huge chain of explosions. Satori manages to survive the explosion, but loses his focus, and thats when Luffy appears and grabs him, rendering him unable to move or escape. Sanji, although hurt by the explosions, is determined to pay the priest back, for kidnapping his favorite ladies, regardless of the consequences being that they will become first class criminals. As Luffy still holds on Satori, Sanji delivers a strong kick on his head and finally defeats him.
