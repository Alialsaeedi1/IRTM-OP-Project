Shocked by the news that the blueprints are fake, the two masked men continue to stay silent as Paulie explains he knows nothing about them nor what they are after. The pair decide to eliminate him since he is now involved however, they are interrupted by Luffy who comes crashing through the wall and initially notices a beaten Paulie before the two masked men. The skull-masked man kicks the wall just as Luffy manages to escape, breaking it with ease. Shocked by the strength of the kick, the bull masked man sneaks behind Luffy and restrains him to the ground. Restraining Paulie as well before they leave, the pair arrange with the others to meet in the bedroom and to not shoot Iceburg. The musketeer is seen easily defeating Peepley Lulu while making their escape. One of the carpenters notes that "she" is escaping. While trapped in the Presidents Room, Paulie and Luffy both agree to fight together for Iceburg and Robin respectively. Back in the bedroom, all the members of CP9 arrive, one picking up Rob Luccis hat on the way in. Hattori is also flying into the room and perches himself on the bull masked mans shoulders as he reveals himself to be Rob Lucci. It is seen outside that the defeated "Rob Lucci" and "Kaku" are simply look-a-likes as the skull-masked man is revealed to be Kaku. Kalifa also reveals herself to be the musketeer and Blueno, the bartender, as the Doa Doa no Mi user. Shocked by the fact that they are CP9, he sits listening as Rob Lucci tell him to state the blueprints location or else there will be more victims.
