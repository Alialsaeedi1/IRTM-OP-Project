Realizing it has been Zoro in their grasp all along, Arlong explains that since he has the highest bounty in all of East Blue, its natural that a bounty hunter would want to take him out. He wonders where Zoro could be, to which Usopp responds that he doesnt know and asks to be let go. Though his lie doesnt fool anyone, Arlong then gets the idea to kill Usopp to get Zoro to show up, but Usopp tells them that this wont work and asks Nami for help. Causing more doubt among the crew about Namis loyalty, and Usopp berates her for betraying Luffy saying that even now he still trusts her, to which Nami calls him an idiot. Hatchan then returns, and is surprised that Arlong is back and that his comrades are hurt, and is even more surprised to learn that it was Zoro who did it, telling the crew that he just gave him a ride to Cocoyasi Village because he was looking for Arlong and he thought Zoro was Arlongs guest. Which makes Arlong happy that Zoro is looking for him, Hatchan then asks who Usopp is. Nami, in order to prove her allegiance, attacks Usopp. She announces he will kill him and appears to stab him from Arlongs point of view. Johnny watches unseen from the bushes. Nami then pushes Usopp into the pool which solidifies the crews trust of her, and she reminds them again of her goal - to purchase back her hometown village. Luffy, Sanji, Yosaku, and Zoro all arrive at Arlong Park and are pulled ashore by Momoo.
