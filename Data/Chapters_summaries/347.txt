The four remaining Straw Hat Pirates along with Paulie break into the bedroom to be greeted by the sight of an injured Iceburg surrounded by Nico Robin and the CP9 members. Paulie is shocked when he realizes the situation and with Luccis voice confirming that his friends are really his enemies, he begins to attack. Rob Lucci, however, stabs Paulie with only his finger after using Shigan. Lucci then explains that the members of CP9 have all trained countless hours to make their bodies into weapons and have mastered numerous skills that soar above normal human capabilities, Rokushiki. As Lucci is about to eliminate Paulie, Luffy attacks him with Gomu Gomu no Gatling only for it to have no effect on Lucci after he uses Tekkai. Using Soru, Lucci manages to hit Luffy with Shigan to the neck. Luffy, who only escapes instant death due to his rubbery body, brings Paulie to where he and the Straw Hat Pirates are and explains to the CP9 that they promised to defeat those who were trying to kill Iceburg. The Straw Hat Pirates then ask Robin to explain why she wishes to leave the crew and she states that if she is to stay with them, the dream which she would sacrifice anything for, would never be achieved. Iceburg interrupts only for Robin to attack to stop him interfering to the shock of those around her. Chopper asks if she is truly their enemy, but before she could reply, Lucci interrupts and informs the that the mansion will be engulfed in flames within two minutes, commenting that fire is an efficient way to destroy evidence. Lucci advises the Straw Hats to evacuate, if they can, as Kalifa, Kaku, and Blueno prepare to confront them. As Luffy is asked by Zoro if he is okay with Robin leaving the crew, he replies to him that he is not, and the four Straw Hats prepare for battle.
