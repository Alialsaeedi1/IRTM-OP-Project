Luffy continues to make his way to the front gate with ease using a new move where he controls the arms and legs of a Marine. When they think they have the better of him, he easily dodges their attacks and continues on his way right over the main gate and into the main island. Spandam is shocked by this asking if he defeated Oimo and Kashii however, it is learned that they are still asleep and the Marines are told to wake the pair up. As the conversation finishes, the Franky Family and Galley-La Company invade the island easily defeating many Marines in the progress. As they reach the gates, they struggle to open them but finally do and progress through. As they are about to reach the main gates, Oimo and Kashii appear and they are revealed to be two giants who work as the gate keepers. Meanwhile, Luffy is seen completely surrounded by over ten thousand men.
