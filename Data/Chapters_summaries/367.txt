The Galley-La Members along with the Franky Family continue their attempts to stop the Aqua Laguna from hitting the Rocketman however nothing at all seems to be working. As they continue, Kokoro explains that although the rails will rise, they will not rise high enough to avoid the wave nor would they survive if they directly hit it. As Nami continues her phone call with Sanji, Luffy and Zoro climb up and attack the wave using Gomu Gomu no Sanbyaku Pound Cannon and they safely make it through the Aqua Laguna to the delight of the others. As the pair enter the Rocketman, they are informed that Sanji is on the Den Den Mushi and after a conversation with them, Sanji decides to go after Robin. After hearing of what Robin had done for them, Franky decides to assist them in saving her as if she is caught, it puts him in danger too. However, Usopp tells the pair he will not help since this has nothing to do with him nor does he want to wage war upon the World Government. Despite having nowhere to go, Usopp leaves the pair where they are standing. Meanwhile, in coach seven, T Bone continues to give aid to those who were injured by Sanji while Wanze and Nero are informed about the latest turn in events. One marine notices the window is open and upon looking on the roof, spots Sanji and Franky. However, before he can attack, he is hit by Metallic Star and as the pair look to see who it was, they notice a man who calls himself "Sogeking".
