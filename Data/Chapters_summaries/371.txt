The Rocketman continues on its way towards Enies Lobby while those onboard attempt to pass the time by discussing what they had just witnessed. They are then interrupted by Luffy alerting them that there is a train up ahead however the others are instantly suspicious as it is way too soon for them to have caught up. It is revealed to be the last two cars of the Puffing Tom and since they cannot stop the train, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Rocket to propel himself towards the train to check and see if any allies are onboard. Once he lands, he signals to the Rocketman that no allies are onboard, just Government officials. As Zambai proposes that he instantly dismantles the train cars as they pass to avoid crashing, Luffy calls for Zoro and tells him to cut the cars, as they are in the way. Obliging, Zoro slices the cars in half using Nitoryu Iai: Rashomon, shocking everyone onboard the Rocketman and the unharmed passengers of the train cars, allowing them to easily pass by without crashing. Noticing defeated Sea Kings up ahead, Zoro then realizes there is someone stronger close by, putting on his bandanna. Up ahead, T Bone continues to make his way back towards the Puffing Tom however notices that there is a Sea Train behind him meaning something has happened to the cars he left behind. As he prepares to attack, he is easily defeated by Zoro using Santoryu: Gyuki: Yuzume and the Rocketman continues ahead.
