On the rooftop, the four remaining Straw Hats continue to discuss what Robin said to Sanji and Chopper. Since she stated that the situation will get worse, they conclude that the only way that things could get any worse would be if the assassination would be successful. They continue to discuss what the connection between Robin and the masked man may be which leads Luffy to declare that they will go and catch Robin in order to find out the truth as speculating is no use. Usopp is seen attempting to buy supplies with a small handful of money from a store. Although at first, he is refused, the shop owner finally agrees after Usopp reveals he is willing to trade in his tools. Watching him struggle forward with the items, he gives Usopp some food and then continues to watch him leave. Once back at the Going Merry, it is revealed that Usopp has decided to ride out the Aqua Laguna. At Bluenos Bar, Franky suddenly rages out of the bar followed closely by Mozu and Kiwi. A confused Blueno wonders what happened while Kokoro simply says she has no idea how idiots think. Paulie and a group of Galley-La members decide to return to the Galley-La Headquarters while citizens hiding in the shipyard basement all discuss the rumors they heard about the Straw Hat Pirates. Back at the Galley-La Company Headquarters, all the workers are seen guarding the outside while the elite five are all guarding Iceburgs bedroom. Inside, Kalifa is curious about why Iceburg keeps Nico Robins bounty in his room to which he simply states that it is because she is a devil. Outside, the Straw Hats are seen spying for chaos to start at the headquarters in a tree some distance away while someone wearing heeled shoes appears on a rooftop close to the building.
