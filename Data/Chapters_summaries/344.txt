Enraged at the sight of his two friends defeated, Tilestone attacks the bear-masked man who easily smashes it to pieces with only his fist. Tilestone, who never loses in strength, is easily defeated by one blow causing the other carpenters to panic. Outside the Galley-La Headquarters, the three remaining Straw Hats are seen being chased by a large number of carpenters while wondering where Luffy has gone. Zoro, sick of being chased, charges at the carpenters while attacking using the back of his swords as to not cause any serious injuries (although Nami and Chopper both state that he still is). Luffy, who is finally free, uses Gomu Gomu Rocket to get into the Galley-La Headquarters. In Iceburgs room, he laughs that he never expected to meet Robin like this. Iceburg suddenly draw guns and he states that he wants to kill her as she is the only one who could revive the ancient weapons written in True History. Robin says that Iceburg is an outsider to this however, he reveals that he hold blueprints to the ancient weapon Pluton. He explains that the blueprints were handed down to him from Tom and that he should have burned them when the World Government found out. As he is about to pull the trigger, Robin restrains him and he states that the group who have really been deceived is CP9. In the Presidents Room, Paulie still has the blueprints tightly in his grasp despite being covered in blood. As he falls to the ground defeated, he informs the two masked men that the blueprints are fakes.
