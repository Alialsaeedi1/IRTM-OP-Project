The CP9 are all reunited as Rob Lucci confirms that both Cutty Flam and Robin are in custody. Despite this, both Lucci and Jabra appear to show rivalry between one and other while both Kaku and Kumadori tell them to calm down and show affection towards their long seen friends. All of a sudden, the four returning CP9 attack Fukurou and it is revealed that he can count their strength in Doriki and he orders all the members in strength. Despite the reunion turning more into a comedy show, Spandam interrupts them and shows them a chest with two Devil Fruits. Nico Robin and Franky are then brought into the room and as Spandam insults Tom, Franky bites his head and Robin watches as he is then taken down by Kumadori. While this is happening, it is seen that Spandams Den Den Mushi has been left off the hook preventing him from finding out the trouble being caused on the island. Luffy continues towards the courthouse where the three headed judge, Baskerville, waits.
