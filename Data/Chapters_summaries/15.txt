Boodle challenges Buggy over the matter of the town. While the crew laugh, Cabaji, Buggys staff offers to deal with the mayor himself and leaps into the air to strike him down. Buggy steps in and tells Cabaji to back off, as the mayor challenged him directly. Boodles claim that the town is his treasure amuses Buggy, who only views gold and silver as treasure. Buggy splits his right arm off and sends it flying towards the mayor, grabbing him by the throat and lifting him off the ground. Trying to get Buggy off him, Boodle strikes at his throat where the hand is holding it. He struggles for air while Buggy gloats that, after this town, he plans on heading out into the Grand Line and stealing all the treasures there. Boodless efforts amuse him, but Luffy appears in time to save the man and pulls the hand off Boodles neck. Buggy re-attaches his hand as Nami tells Zoro and Luffy to fight, while she grabs the Grand Line map and any treasures she can find nearby. The mayor is displeased about seeing Luffy and the others, as he wanted to fight Buggy on his own. Luffy however renders the mayor unconscious with a punch (much to Namis shock), in order to make sure he is safe and does not get in the way. Luffy then calls out to Buggy, shouting "Hey, big nose!" to provoke him. Because of his reputation of overreacting to anything related to his nose, Buggys crew, Zoro and Nami are all horrified. Buggy then demands that his crew load another Buggy Ball into the cannon, while Zoro and Nami flee for cover. Launching the powerful cannonball towards Luffy, the rubber man blows himself up like a balloon and shoots the cannonball straight back at the Buggy Pirates.
