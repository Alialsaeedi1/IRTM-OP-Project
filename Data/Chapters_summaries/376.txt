On the Rocketman, Usopp introduces himself as Sogeking, a friend of Usopp and both Luffy and Chopper believe this despite the others pointing out that it is obviously Usopp. They continue to watch as Luffy and Chopper continue to fall for this act. Sanji interrupts them and informs them of the knowledge that Blueno gave them just before he escaped. After hearing this, Luffy becomes more determined to save her. Paulie reveals that he has been to Enies Lobby before and reveals that he drew a map to remember where everything was. He states that if Franky and/or Nico Robin reach the Gates of Justice, they will be unable to rescue them. They decide that the Galley-La Company and the Franky Family will charge in first to clear the gates, so the Straw Hat Pirates can avoid minor fights and can concentrate on the CP9. As they observe the size of the gates, they realize that Luffy has charged in on his own despite hearing the plan. The Franky Family and Galley-La Company chase after him while the Marines notice him only as an intruder. However, they soon find out his identity and Spandam orders them to kill him. As he easily defeats the guards, the Franky Family and Galley-La Company make it over the gate as the Rocketman prepares to make its way in five minutes time.
