Angel Islands residents hastily to the clouds end. They are asking the Militias whereabout but Conis did not have the courage to speak of the tragedy. McKinley suddenly interrupt and guaranteed that the White Beret will find the Militia to safety and commanded the citizens to leave immediately. He actually knows that Enel was an evil person and the Birka tragedy must not repeat where Enel destroyed it six years ago. McKinley revealed that many people fought against Enel. For the sake of the citizens, White Beret betrayed the Militia to protect the island. Conis left and leave the evacuation to McKinley. Enel demanded respect from Luffy as he himself is a god but Luffy did not see him as a god. Aisa praised Luffy for his braveness. Nami tells Luffy to be careful and Enel stared coldly at her. Luffy felt angrier as Enel laughed on the fate of the Skypiean and Luffy dashed towards Enel and attacked Luffy with his lightning. Dumbfounded Luffy stands firmly, Enel launched second and third attack and still Luffy was unaffected, yet it annoys Luffy and responded with a punch and Enel evaded it. Nami thought that maybe it is because of his rubber body make him able to withstand Enels lightning. Luffy reattacked Enel and welcomes it as he proudly thought that physical attack will not harm him but it proves otherwise. Nami concluded that it because rubber nulls out electricity and Luffy became Enels natural enemy.
