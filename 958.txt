25 years ago, Kozuki Oden expressed his appreciation for being able to join Gol D. Roger on his voyage. Silvers Rayleigh, Shanks, and Buggy offered to help him in his quest to open Wano Countrys borders, but Oden replied that he should handle this alone; he was confident that with the help of his retainers, he could become shogun and accomplish his goal. In the present day, Act 3 of the Wano Country Arc begins. In Port Habu in Hakumai, Orochi boards a ship headed for Onigashima and the Fire Festival, and Fukurokuju says to let people know that Kyoshiro has been placed in charge of the Flower Capital for the time being. Orochi starts drinking immediately upon setting sail, and in the Flower Capital, the citizens begin to party and take advantage of the only day they are allowed alcohol. While they and Orochi enjoy beautiful weather, Momonosuke and the Nine Red Scabbards come to Port Tokage to find that not only is it storming heavily, but their ships and allies are nowhere in sight. Momonosuke says that they should change the date of their rendezvous, and Kinemon desperately tries calling their allies on the Tanishi. However, he cannot reach any of them, and his pleas quickly become desperate before Ashura Doji silences him. Ashura notes that the port looks like it was attacked, and as the Scabbards start to lose hope of their allies showing up, Inuarashi finds a boat that looks intact and prepares to sail out to Onigashima alone. On Onigashima, Orochi parties as he thinks about an incident that occurred the previous day.
