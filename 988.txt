Kaidou faces the minks and remembers that the full moon allows them to use their Sulong forms. Jack, several Gifters, and one of the Numbers reach the rooftop. Nekomamushi and Inuarashi step forward to take on Jack themselves, but the Guardians and Musketeers transform and fight Jack instead, so that Nekomamushi and Inuarashi can focus on Kaidou. Down below, Shinobu tries and fails to free Momonosuke. King grabs her and throws her away. Suddenly, Momonosukes chains break and the boy floats through the air. King attacks him, but Sanji, who was invisible, blocks the kick. Sanji then throws Momonosuke to Shinobu, and King transforms into a pteranodon and drives his beak into Sanjis stomach. The two crash into a wall. Even though Yamato is busy fighting Ulti, Luffy tells Yamato to go help Shinobu protect Momonosuke. Big Mom comes charging at Luffy and plans to kill all the invaders so they can restart the party. She swings Napoleon and blasts a hole through the side of Onigashima. She then calls for Zeus, and when he does not appear, she spots Nami running off with the cloud again. Big Mom steals him back and prepares to strike down Nami. However, Brook slices the cloud into two, while Franky drives the Kurosai FR-U IV over Big Moms face.
